f,reply_y,yes
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,if you just want to come like down past the extinct volcano down to like to towards the bottom of the page
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,instruct,just straight down directly south
g,reply_y,uh-huh just straight down
g,acknowledge,uh south
f,query_w,how far
g,instruct,south down to about equal to where the tribal settlement is further on
f,align,equal to where the tribal settlement is

f,acknowledge,the bottom of the page
g,check,you've not got to the left-hand side a tribal settlement
f,reply_n,no i haven't
g,instruct,well you're going to go down about three centimetres down to where it the word says extinct volcano
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,align,okay
g,instruct,then you're going to start going along west
f,instruct,west right okay for
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,keep on going until you're maybe about three centimetres from the the left-hand side of the page
f,instruct,from the left-hand s--
f,check,that's quite a bit
g,acknowledge,uh-huh it's quite far along
g,acknowledge,'kay
f,reply_y,right okay
g,clarify,so just about three in-- three centimetres from the left-hand side

f,acknowledge,right okay
f,query_yn,dir-- just directly down
f,acknowledge,straight down
g,reply_w,just directly down
f,instruct,to the secret valley
g,check,uh-huh just to the bottom of the where it says secret valley

f,check,to the finish no
f,explain,i've not got a finish
g,explain,well the finish is actually
g,align,you know where it says secret valley
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,it's just about a centimetre along from that and down a wee bit that's where the f--
f,check,from the edge of the letter "y"
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,uncodable,centim--
