f,acknowledge,alright
g,explain,not as far as that aye you're about it should be about an inch away
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,no right

g,instruct,about an inch beyond th-- the apex of the bend
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,query_yn,now you don't have farm land do you
f,uncodable,eh
f,reply_n,no
g,explain,no i knew you didn't

f,query_w,where in which direction
g,align,to the right
f,acknowledge,to the right
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,this is once i'm beyond the apex of the curve
g,reply_y,yeah
f,query_w,how far should i be beyond the apex of the curve
g,instruct,well should be about an inch an inch and a half down
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,you've got
f,check,and then horizontally
g,instruct,down to the right about three inches
f,acknowledge,right

g,explain,but i
g,explain,i've got
f,query_w,how far am i from the right-hand side of the page just now when i'm when i'm heading horizontally right

g,align,you you've moved down
f,reply_n,no i haven't yet
g,acknowledge,oh right
f,explain,i've gone i've gone i've gone horizontal so far after the apex of the curve and then going horizontal
f,uncodable,th--
