g,reply_y,did i say that yeah
f,ready,right wait a minute
g,reply_w,up very slightly to the right
f,explain,i'm go-- i've to go along the bottom of the diamond diamond mine first
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,so i'm
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,ehm from the "e" in mine
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,i go another maybe six centimetres in the same direction
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,and then move if you move around and up to the left almost vertically but not quite
f,check,around
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,to
f,explain,so right i'm i'm at the moment i'm about halfway between the diamond mine and the highest viewpoint
g,reply_y,yeah right
g,instruct,if you go along another maybe two or three centimetres then
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then up and around to the left almost vertically but not quite
f,acknowledge,right oh
g,instruct,'til you get to about level with the bottom of the mountain or hill
f,acknowledge,oh right okay mmhmm
g,align,okay
g,instruct,and then just move around the top about a centimetre space between the your route and the mountain if you just go right around to the
f,check,so wait a minute i'm going right round the top of the mountain then
g,reply_y,uh-huh uh-huh
f,check,a cu-- just curving right round
g,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,until you get to the bottom of the mountain at the right-hand side
g,acknowledge,you got that yeah
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,instruct,now move down about f-- six centimetres
f,check,just just ver-- straight down
g,reply_y,just vertically down yeah
f,query_yn,have you got the overgrown gully
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,all right
f,query_yn,have you got the safari truck
g,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,and if when you stop you should be about two centimetres above the safari truck
f,check,to the right of it

g,instruct,and move down about forty-five degrees to the left
g,query_yn,do you have the field station
f,acknowledge,no oh
g,reply_n,no

g,reply_y,yeah yeah
f,check,so going down but to the left at the same time
g,reply_y,mmhmm
g,clarify,when you stop you should be about two centimetres from safari truck and a wee bit below it
f,acknowledge,right
g,align,okay
g,instruct,and now just move along to the left
f,query_w,in what way horizontal straight across
g,reply_y,yeah
g,query_yn,do you have the banana tree
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,instruct,if you move along and round the top of that
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,check,so is it straight across
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,check,and then round
g,instruct,the top of the banana tree
g,instruct,and down on the left-hand side of it
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,for about twenty centimetres
f,acknowledge,all right
f,check,so a good bit down then
g,reply_y,yeah
f,query_yn,have you got the
g,query_yn,do you have the gold mine
f,reply_n,no
g,reply_n,no
g,reply_y,yeah

g,instruct,you're about i'd say about ten fifteen centimetres above the great lake
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,acknowledge,okay
g,ready,right ehm
g,instruct,if you move along
g,query_yn,do you have the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,ehm uh-huh
f,explain,i've got one over at the right about halfway down the page
g,reply_y,uh-huh that's right
g,instruct,if you move along horizontally about three or four centimetres
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,check,sort of diagonally
g,instruct,and then once you've done that move up to the rope bridge just from where you are to the rope bridge and then cross it

f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,curving round a little to maybe two centimetres or so
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,and then move vertically down to the giraffes
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,okay
f,explain,so i'm at the the right of the giraffes
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,ready,okay so
f,query_w,what do i do now
g,instruct,ehm you sh-- you should be around about at the "s" in giraffe about a centimetre below it
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and then curve round slightly for about four five centimetres
f,query_w,what going going left
g,reply_y,going left sorry yeah
f,check,so curving up the way
g,reply_n,no curving down
f,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,have you got the disused warehouse
g,reply_n,no i don't
f,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,am i going quite near the bottom of the page here then
g,reply_n,no
g,instruct,once you once you've moved you should be about maybe five centimetres from bottom of page
g,instruct,and start to curve up the way instead but still going left
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,i think i'm probably to go underneath the warehouse then
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and move that down almost vertically down but not quite for about two centimetres
f,query_w,wait a minute where am i in relation to the great lake now then well i mean
g,align,you should be about
f,explain,at the moment i'm about level with the great lake but about th-- two three centimetres to the right of it
g,reply_y,mm that's about okay
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,so i'm going back down again
g,instruct,if you come down so you're about a centimetre below the great lake and just move underneath the great lake
f,check,oh right go underneath it
f,check,so just straight across then to the left
g,reply_y,straight across
g,instruct,until you get to the "g"
f,explain,s-- i'll just score that wee bit out then
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,and if you curve up to the left ehm about five centimetres
g,query_yn,do you have the rock fall
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,explain,you should you should finish about two centimetres below the rock fall and about five centimetres to the left of the rock fall
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,that's the finish then
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,right
