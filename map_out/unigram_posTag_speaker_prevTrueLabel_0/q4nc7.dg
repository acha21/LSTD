g,query_yn,you got an extinct volcano
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,query_yn,you got a cross above it
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,start
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,query_yn,you have got a tribal settlement down at the left-hand side of your page
f,reply_n,no
g,ready,right
g,instruct,what you're going to do is you're going to from the start you're going to go left and you're going to go down down you know like you're going to go across a bit and down to the bottom of the extinct volcano
g,align,know what i mean
f,check,across
f,query_yn,have you got the machete
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,oh right
f,query_yn,have you got the rope bridge
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,query_w,where do i go across to
g,instruct,right you're just heading down to the left diagonally down to the bottom of the extinct volcano 'til you're about a centimetre left of the "e" in extinct volcano
f,acknowledge,ah
g,align,okay
g,align,see your "e"
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,ready,right
g,instruct,go along about a centimetre and draw a dot
f,check,to the left
g,reply_y,uh-huh to the left
f,check,above the "e"
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,oh right
g,clarify,b-- just d-- st-- across from the "e"
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,check,just a centimetre and draw a dot
g,clarify,just about a centimetre and a half
g,instruct,and draw from your start draw a line from your start down to that dot
f,check,down to it
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,diagonally down
f,check,not across to it
g,explain,well it's kind of down 'cause your start's above the extinct volcano
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,so you've drawn a line down to th-- there
f,query_w,to where
f,acknowledge,right
g,explain,to that dot that i've just given you about a centimetre from the extinct volcano
f,acknowledge,oh right
g,align,okay
f,query_w,what to the left of the "e"
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,oh right okay
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,so you're going down that way and right keep on going down 'til you're about three centimetres from the bottom of the page
f,check,so i'm in a diagonal at the moment
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,you're to go down like diagonally
f,check,and we're past we don't go through the old volcano no
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,you're just going down the side of the volcano until you're level with the the extinct
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,instruct,diagonally go down towards the left about another two centimetres continue your line for about another two centimetres
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,down
g,align,okay
f,ready,so like
g,ready,then st--
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,so you're getting towards the bottom of the page
f,acknowledge,okay
g,ready,right
g,ready,now stop
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,instruct,now you you sh-- you should be about two or three centimetres from the bottom of the page
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,reply_w,y-- on my map i've got a tribal settlement along to the left towards the left-hand side of the page
f,reply_n,no i haven't
g,instruct,and what you're going to do is draw a straight line to the left
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,until you're about three centimetres from the left-hand side of the page
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,okay so just draw a straight line
f,reply_w,until you're about three centimetres
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,centimetres from the left-hand side of the page to your left okay
g,instruct,then stop
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,ready,right
g,align,see your rope bridge
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,you're now going to go up the page

g,align,just under the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're going straight right
g,instruct,until you're underneath the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're about th-- two centimetres below the "o" of the collapsed shelter actually
f,query_yn,is there not a squiggly line there
f,reply_w,'cause i've got a machete in between the rope bridge and the collapsed shelter i couldn't go straight across
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,that's why you're going down
f,acknowledge,oh right okay
f,acknowledge,oh okay
g,align,see i've taken you down diagonally right and then now you're going straight across right
g,align,see what i mean
f,reply_n,oh no no

f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,i'm taking you down right and then across
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay i'm taking you down a wee bit down a wee "u" shape
f,check,is it not a couple of inches

f,acknowledge,uh-huh okay right
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,i'll draw in that
f,reply_y,uh-huh

f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,query_yn,you've got the white mountain up above the saxon barn
g,instruct,well what we're going to do is we're going down and we're doing a "u" shape to miss these pelicans
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,so what you're doing is you're
f,query_yn,are they in a straight are they like horizontal to the saxon barn
g,query_yn,are there they're horizontal to the saxon barn
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,explain,but they're they're th-- they're they're they're down a bit they're in between the saxon barn and the rope bridge if you can think about it
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,see to like to make a triangle see the point of the triangle
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,query_yn,if you make a triangle from saxon barn to rope bridge at the point and that's where the pelicans are
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,see if you join the rope bridge and the saxon barn together
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,and then like you make a triangle out of it
f,acknowledge,right okay
