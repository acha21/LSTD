f,query_yn,is there anything between the mountain and what is parallel to the field station
g,reply_n,no there's absolutely nothing there
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,so i could just drop right down then
g,reply_y,you can drop right down there yeah
f,acknowledge,okay
f,check,and just go on the same level then
