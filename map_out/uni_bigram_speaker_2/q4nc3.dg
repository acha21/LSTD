g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,query_yn,up at the top left-hand page
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,check,and you've got a burnt forest beside you just below it
f,acknowledge,right
g,explain,what my map says is it's actually a curved line but i don't know whether to give you a curved line or a straight line i'll give you a curved line right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,query_yn,have you got anything like to the r-- to the left of the burnt forest
f,reply_w,i've got a burnt forest and then straight below it i've got a carpenter's cottage then a ravine that's all i've got
g,explain,well i haven't got the carpenter's cottage
f,acknowledge,it's
g,check,is that directly beside the ravine
f,acknowledge,uh-huh it's directly
g,clarify,a wee bit up
f,reply_w,well a wee bit up but i-- near enough
g,query_yn,have you got the remote village
f,reply_y,n-- up at up at this side
g,reply_w,beside the burnt forest
f,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,explain,no well what i suggest you do lllll ehm is like right there's a there's a line about quarter of the way down and it's the bottom of it it's from the start right and the bottom of it is in parallel with the ravine
g,acknowledge,you know the word
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,ready,ravine
g,query_yn,have you got that
f,reply_w,i've got ravine
g,ready,right
g,instruct,so it's like
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,so i start from start an--
g,check,and it's like a curve
f,query_yn,will i go underneath the burnt forest
g,reply_n,no no you don't
f,ready,no sorry
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,it's just like a r-- a kind of slight curve
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,uh-huh and it's just to parallel with the ravine the word ravine
g,ready,okay
f,ready,aye wait a minute
f,check,which way am i going
f,explain,right i'm at the start
g,acknowledge,sorry yeah
g,explain,it's a
f,explain,you know what i mean i'm
g,clarify,it's a curve to the right
f,query_yn,a curve to the right
f,check,you've
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,reply_n,no
f,check,not got the burnt forest you have got ah no you haven't
g,query_yn,i have got the burnt forest
g,check,and it's not through it it's like
f,check,so i'm going a curve and it goes down to the ravine
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,jus--
g,reply_n,no not to the ravine parallel with it
g,align,bu-- right the bottom of the curve is like parallel with the word start
g,align,do you know what i mean
g,clarify,it's just a curve
g,query_yn,know what a curve is
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,check,right and i'm going towards down towards the ravine
g,align,well the bottom of it
f,explain,sorry i can't
g,acknowledge,right
f,reply_y,right
g,instruct,just draw a straight line
f,acknowledge,oh right oh god a straight line
g,clarify,okay just draw a straight line
f,reply_w,oh but it's kind of curvy
g,explain,that'll be easy uh-huh
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,explain,but i'm still up at i'm still up at the top of page
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,explain,right i get what you mean now
f,check,at the top of the burnt
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right okay right
g,instruct,and you s-- finish your curve at where's the start you know parallel ehm just parallel no no no no f-- just down from start
g,ready,okay an--
f,acknowledge,right okay okay i've got it i've got it i've got it
f,acknowledge,ah right
g,reply_w,and it's like parallel to the ravine the bottom of it is like well not parallel but on the same line as the ravine
f,explain,on the straight line i've go-- it's kind of like as though it's just dubbed directly above the "a"
g,check,what
f,clarify,sorry on you go
f,explain,right i've drawn this line
g,reply_y,right
g,check,is it is it stopping just down from start in a straight line from start
f,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,well it's kind of curvy
g,acknowledge,uh-huh good good
g,align,curvy to the right
f,reply_y,i'm all right curvy to the right
g,ready,right
g,instruct,and then you go across and stop
g,acknowledge,aye
f,explain,this is a-- by the way this is about like five centimetres down from the top of the page this about right
g,ready,yeah
f,reply_y,aye right okay
g,clarify,it should stop at v-- you know doing the just in a straight line from the ravine
g,acknowledge,right
f,reply_y,right i've got it
g,instruct,in a straight line to like a straight line across like
f,check,towards the pine grove
f,check,you got a pine grove
g,reply_y,no uh-huh yeah yeah
g,check,no not across to there
g,clarify,vertical right a vertical line this is quite good vertical line and stop just where the "r" is in forest down from forest
g,align,do you know what i mean
f,acknowledge,oh wait a minute a vertical line
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,reply_n,oh no no
g,instruct,a horizontal line
f,check,you mean i'm going down towards the ravine i'll be in the ravine
g,explain,right a vertical a
f,check,towards the right
g,reply_y,horizontal line mmhmm
f,query_w,and where do i stop
g,reply_w,just down from where the "r" is
g,align,okay
f,check,from pine grove
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,ready,right
f,explain,oh i'm not allowed to move
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,and then and then
g,instruct,go up again ehm you know how you got the ravine just go up and past the ravine
g,query_yn,have you got the remote village no
f,reply_w,i'm a-- i'm really past the ravine by now
f,explain,i'm at the pine grove i'm at at towards the right-hand side of the page
g,instruct,well go back don't pass the pi-- don't pass the ravine
f,check,oh the "r" of the ravine
g,align,pardon
f,check,i thought you meant the "r" of the pine grove
g,reply_n,no
f,check,right wait a minu--
g,acknowledge,don't pass the ravine okay
g,explain,it's the "r" of the burnt forest i was talking about
f,check,oh so you this line was only about two centimetres long
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,i'm not past the ravine
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,clarify,and go up
f,check,up
g,ready,up now
f,check,up towards the top of the page
g,reply_n,no
g,instruct,up towards just right up to the top of the ravine past the birds
f,check,you mean down to the ravine
g,reply_n,no
g,instruct,up right up to the top of the ravine
f,reply_w,i'm above the ravine
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,you're kidding
f,ready,right okay wait a minute right
f,explain,i came from the burnt forest
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,explain,and i came and i did a d-- a kind of a curvy right just to like towards like
f,explain,you see where it says burnt forest
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,explain,just about parallel where it says burnt forest so i'm up there
f,query_yn,do you know where i am
g,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,about five centimetres from the top of the page
g,instruct,do you want to start again
f,acknowledge,right
g,align,right start okay
f,reply_y,right
g,instruct,vertical line down to the r-- ravine
f,acknowledge,oh just vertically down
g,reply_y,uh-huh vertically down
g,align,okay
f,ready,right
f,check,down towards
g,explain,but missing out anything that might be in between
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,okay
f,query_w,can you do this
f,reply_y,aye
g,instruct,i think you can
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,right vertically down 'til you're like in a straight
g,ready,okay
f,reply_y,right
f,explain,i'm at diag--
f,acknowledge,right i know what you mean now
f,explain,right i'm at the ravine
f,check,and then i go along to where it says "r" of the ravine
g,acknowledge,no
g,check,you go along to where it says "r" of the burnt forest
f,acknowledge,oh right
g,explain,a horizontal line
g,reply_y,okay
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,just in line with the "r" of the burnt forest
f,acknowledge,oh right i've got you now right i've got that
g,instruct,and then you go up a vertical line
f,check,to the top of the ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,explain,and i've got the carpenter's cottage
f,explain,so i have to miss that
g,reply_y,yeah you'll have to miss that
f,check,so see the wee seagulls at the ravine
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,just about up there
g,reply_y,above that yeah
f,acknowledge,oh i've got you now right
g,instruct,and then a horizontal line
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,under the remote village
g,query_yn,have you got that
f,reply_n,i've not got the remote village is it
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,well don't go very far just go a little bit above the seagulls in the ravine
g,acknowledge,okay
f,ready,right
g,instruct,and then draw a horizontal line
f,check,just to about the end of the ravine
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,ready,right
g,reply_w,well a wee bit further
f,acknowledge,right
g,align,okay
f,check,have to just towards halfway between the pine grove no
f,check,you got the pine grove
g,reply_y,no i ha-- oh yeah i have yeah
g,acknowledge,right uh-huh across to there
f,explain,oh as far as that
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,clarify,it doesn't matter i'm just going to tell you to draw straight lines
f,acknowledge,okay
g,ready,okay
g,instruct,and like you go right go in a vertical line down just until you you're underneath the pine grove
f,align,right okay
g,instruct,okay
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,and then
g,uncodable,ehm
g,explain,oh i can't get you
g,query_w,have you got anything
f,reply_w,i've got an avalanche
g,explain,i haven't got that
g,query_w,where's that
f,acknowledge,right see the pine grove
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,it's just below it to your right
g,acknowledge,below it right
g,instruct,tell you what miss out
g,query_yn,have you got i don't think you'll have the concealed hideout
f,reply_y,i do
g,uncodable,have you oh you do
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,oh well right just draw a line right draw a line until
g,instruct,what you've got to do is
g,explain,i would suppose that your avalanche is ehm miss-- right your avalanche is like outwith the line
g,align,do you know what i mean
f,reply_y,uh-huh yeah it is
g,explain,so like the line is within well m-- in my map i think the line is within the avalanche
f,check,the avalanche is quite far to the right
g,instruct,okay right
g,explain,what you do is w-- wh-- in my picture i've got two och how could you say bumps right i would say the avalanche is missed out it's drawn to miss out the avalanche
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,query_yn,but includes within this line it includes the concealed hideout
f,ready,right
g,instruct,so could you draw something that would
f,query_yn,do you want me to go down towards the concealed hideout
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,missing out the avalanche
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,and goi-- and go round the concealed hideout concealed hideout
f,check,to your right
g,uncodable,uh-huh
g,instruct,go round it and include it in the line
f,align,right i'm just drawing my line underneath the word concealed hideout now
g,acknowledge,oh good right
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,you d-- have you done that yeah d-- drawn it underneath
f,explain,i've drawn my line
f,reply_w,and it's just i'm just at the down below the "t" of concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,oh right okay
g,instruct,well draw a a horizontal line over
g,query_yn,have you got the boat house
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,over to the boat house
g,ready,right
f,check,you mean vertical down to the boat house
g,reply_n,no
g,clarify,horizontal over to the boat house
f,acknowledge,oh right horizontal over to the boat house right
f,explain,okay i'm directly above the boat house now
g,instruct,you're above it
f,reply_y,mmhmm
f,explain,my my boat house is down below crane bay
g,reply_n,i haven't got that
g,clarify,you're above the boat house though
f,explain,i've got a boat house there's crane bay and i've got a boat house just
f,acknowledge,do--
g,reply_y,okay right
g,explain,oh i've got two boat houses
f,acknowledge,alright
f,query_yn,do you do you see do you see where my boat house is
g,reply_y,ehm uh-huh
g,instruct,right well go back up again to the concealed hideout
f,explain,i'm at the concealed hideout
g,align,and you're you've drawn a horizontal line
f,uncodable,i'm just
f,align,see where the boat house is
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,explain,i've got two
f,query_yn,b-- the boat house at crane bay
g,ready,well
f,explain,mm the one the one further down the page
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,check,right
f,explain,i'm just about my line's just about five centimetres above it
g,acknowledge,okay that's good
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,draw it over to the other
g,query_yn,have you got another boat house
f,explain,i've only got one boat house
g,acknowledge,oh right
g,explain,well i've got two
f,acknowledge,oh right
f,explain,i've not
g,explain,i've got one parallel to the concealed hideout well just about
g,instruct,well what you could do is draw a line underneath the concealed hideout until you get
g,align,right see the "b" of crane bay
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,well until you stop at the "b"
f,acknowledge,oh right
f,explain,i've gone along too far then
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,query_yn,stop at the "b"
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and then go right down horizontal i mean vertical go right down
f,check,to what
g,align,you know how you've got that have you got the crane bay have you got the actual outline of it
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,well go right down
f,check,until i touch the outline
g,reply_n,no no no no no
f,ready,right okay
g,clarify,until you're nearly touching it you're maybe just like half a mil-- half a centimetre
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,clarify,away from it
g,align,okay
f,explain,that's me
g,instruct,and f-- and follow it
g,align,you know how that wee curve
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,there's a wee curve
g,instruct,follow that wee curve
g,acknowledge,right
f,instruct,down towards the boat house
g,reply_n,no
g,clarify,the other way sorry the other way to your left
f,check,off to my left
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,just follow that wee hump
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,okay

g,acknowledge,no
g,instruct,oh well what you'll have to do is ehm eh follow that again go over the bump
g,instruct,have you come to the bump
f,acknowledge,i've come to the bump
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,follow it again
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,just so far like ehm uh maybe about two centimetres
f,acknowledge,mmhmm

f,reply_y,right i've done that
g,query_w,and then ehm how could you say this
g,query_yn,have you got the pebbled shore
f,reply_w,i've got the pebbled shore
g,instruct,ehm well come round right follow the line down 'til you're maybe about och say about a centimetre and a half above the pebbled shore
g,align,do you know what i mean
g,reply_y,draw a curve
f,clarify,right just following the coast line
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,reply_y,right okay that's me
g,instruct,and then come up over the pebbled shore
f,check,above it
g,reply_y,uh-huh

f,reply_y,aye
g,align,so are you two mi-- two about two centimetres above from the bottom of the page just now
f,reply_y,i'm about
g,align,are you if in parallel with the flagship
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,explain,or in the same level
g,explain,oh well that's it
f,acknowledge,well no
f,explain,i could go down but i've got the the flagship there's a wee there's a wee bit of bay sticking out
g,acknowledge,uh-huh right

g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,there's a wee bit of bay that juts out
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,do you want me to draw a line round that so i'm going to miss it
g,query_w,where are you oh oh what l-- what side of the pebbled shore are you
g,reply_w,what
f,reply_w,i'm near en-- i'm near enough the right now 'cause i had to miss the washed stones
g,check,you're at the right of it
f,acknowledge,mmhmm

f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,could you go round
f,check,i'll go round the washed stones the other way
g,reply_w,to i don't have the washed stones
g,ready,right so
f,check,you want me to be at the left of the pebbled shore
g,reply_y,uh-huh i want you to go round the left of the pebbled shore
f,acknowledge,oh i did do that
g,acknowledge,oh you did do
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,align,you said the right
f,acknowledge,i know
f,explain,but i'm now at the 'cause i've had to miss the washed stones so i'm now near enough the right
g,query_w,where are your washed stones
f,reply_w,the washed stones are
f,acknowledge,see the pebbled shore
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,they're about three centimetres down to the left
g,acknowledge,oh right okay

f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,oh good
f,check,so i came back round to the right and jutted them out
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,so you're now so where are you now right you're about
f,reply_y,right
f,explain,see the flagship
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,see the wee bit of bay that's jutting out
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,i'm exactly two centimetres up above that about that wee that that wee tip comes out
g,instruct,well go down until you're in a v--
