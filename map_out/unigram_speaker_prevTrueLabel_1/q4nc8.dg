g,ready,okay
g,instruct,paul we're starting top left
f,acknowledge,right you've got a diamond mine
g,reply_y,i've got a diamond mine
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,okay drop s-- straight down to the "d" of
f,acknowledge,right that's okay right okay right
g,align,okay
g,explain,this is very difficult
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,drop drop straight straight down the side of the diamond mine to to the "d" of diamond mine
f,acknowledge,okay
f,check,just below it
g,reply_y,just below it yeah
f,acknowledge,pen's
g,instruct,and then you're going to go right drawing a line underneath diamond mine
f,explain,hold on hold on my pen's run out oh no it's working
g,acknowledge,okay you're going to draw you're going to underline diamond mine
f,acknowledge,underline it right
f,check,so right underline it along to the "e"
f,acknowledge,of diamond
g,clarify,und-- underline it un-- underline it along to the "e"
f,explain,pen's not working very well
g,acknowledge,okay
f,reply_y,right
f,check,of highest viewpoint
g,instruct,right and continue the line until you're until you're directly below the "h" of highest viewpoint
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,so i've just got an an east line a right-hand a line going thr-- to the right all the way from
g,reply_y,a line going
f,acknowledge,okey-doke

g,instruct,just go s-- go right don't go up yet
f,check,i'm about two centimetres from the "h" below it
g,reply_y,yeah you're below the "h" yeah
f,acknowledge,right below it okay
g,align,okay
g,instruct,then go straight up to the seagulls
f,check,straight up to the seagulls

f,query_yn,across from the safari truck at the opposite side of the page virtually the same pa-- position
g,check,how it's virtually the same position
f,check,virtually the same position the other side left-hand side of the page just up slightly
g,instruct,it's up slightly
f,reply_y,aye just slightly aye
g,acknowledge,okay right
f,check,a centimetre up
g,query_w,right what what you've got to do here is you've got to drop down towards the safari truck
f,align,y-- okay
f,query_w,which side of the safari truck
g,clarify,ehm drop down 'til until you're
g,ready,right wait a minute let me see
f,query_w,towards the right-hand side of it or towards
g,reply_w,the the safari truck i think it it looks like a steering wheel on the right-hand side
f,acknowledge,the right-hand side
g,align,can you see it
f,check,is it sort of handlebar type thing
g,align,right see the see the right-hand see the right-hand wheel
f,reply_y,yes
g,clarify,drop down towards that
f,ready,right okay but
g,clarify,and and stop just just above the safari truck
f,query_yn,am i draw--
f,explain,so i'm at the right-hand side of the highest viewpoint at the moment
g,reply_y,yeah uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay and
g,instruct,and you're dropping straight down
f,acknowledge,straight down right
f,check,so i'm going to go through an overgrown gully

g,reply_w,'cause i i don't have an overgrown gully
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,so skirt it and co-- and come back so that you're directly above the right-hand wheel of the safari truck
f,acknowledge,okay
f,query_w,right above where that wee "t" sort of handlebar type thing is
f,reply_y,of the safari truck
g,reply_y,yeah yeah that one yeah
f,acknowledge,right okay

g,instruct,right you now need to turn left
f,explain,okay i'm directly in line with the field station at this
g,acknowledge,right that's fine okay
g,instruct,you you want to turn left and head towards the field station but don't right wait a minute and and stop when you are at er when you're directly below the "t" of highest viewpoint the the f-- "t" of highest
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,stop direct--
f,check,so just doing a straight line
g,reply_y,straight line uh-huh
g,align,okay
f,check,so i'm just at the other side of the safari truck now the left-hand side of it

f,check,due south directly
g,clarify,until due south until you come level with the top leaves of the banana tree
g,acknowledge,okay
f,reply_y,okay
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and then go across and round the top of the banana go left to across and round
g,check,round the top
f,check,so quite a quite a long line
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,round the top
g,instruct,around the top of the banana tree
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,check,and down the side of it
g,clarify,and we're going down the side
f,check,right so i'm going south down the side
g,reply_y,you're going south

f,explain,just straight down south there's a massive line going south
g,reply_y,massive line going south
f,check,so it's a c-- ni--
g,instruct,nearly to the nearly to the top of the rock fall
f,check,and the same line as the start to the bottom of the diamond line mine at the very beginning
g,reply_y,yeah that's right uh-huh yeah yeah
f,acknowledge,right
g,align,that one
g,reply_w,down at you're at the bottom of the rock fall
