g,ready,well
g,query_yn,is that directly along from the saxon barn
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,well go above that
f,check,above the c--
g,instruct,up and you go directly beside the collapsed shelter by about er say fifteen centimetres above the creva-- crevice
f,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,so have you got
f,acknowledge,right so
f,check,go about five centimetres above the crevasse
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,directly above the start point

f,reply_y,uh-huh
f,query_w,which is fifteen centimetres from where i am now
g,ready,eh well
g,instruct,not as much as that
f,ready,well
g,uncodable,ehm
f,acknowledge,okay right
f,check,that's where i want to be
g,reply_w,by about a centimetre above the crevasse then
g,acknowledge,yeah

g,instruct,and go along the top of the crevasse
f,check,to cross to the left-hand side of it
g,uncodable,er
g,uncodable,by
g,align,you've got the saxon barn haven't you
f,reply_y,yeah
g,ready,well
g,instruct,you go along and you go from above the crevasse well from the side down to under just under the saxon barn in a slope
f,explain,so i'm curving ab-- i'm sloping then
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,so i'm now under the saxon barn
f,reply_y,right
g,instruct,er at the right-hand side
g,reply_y,yes well
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and go along 'til you get to the end of the saxon barn

g,acknowledge,below no
g,instruct,go
f,explain,i've got a white mountain
g,query_w,a white mountain whereabouts oh
g,reply_n,no no no no
f,check,directly above the saxon barn
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,reply_n,no it's below
g,instruct,erm go down by about four centimetres
f,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,erm

f,check,just tons to go
f,acknowledge,yeah right
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,check,and you've got the white mountain above you yeah
g,reply_y,so
g,instruct,you go up say six centimetres u-- dilec rectly across from the saxon barn to your left
f,check,so i'm now opposite the saxon barn
g,reply_y,yes
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and you slope towards the white mountain and past the white mountain
g,instruct,the slope
f,check,on the right-hand side
g,reply_w,on the left-hand side
f,check,the left
g,align,by one centimetre
f,explain,but that's not sloping it should be
g,ready,well gentle sl-- very gentle slope
f,check,so i'm now at the left-hand side of the bottom of the white mountain
g,instruct,er go along the side er away from the m-- white mountain by a-- from the s-- left side of a white mountain by about one centimetre
f,explain,am i to go up to the top of the mountain
g,reply_y,yeah
g,clarify,'til you reach the peak
g,instruct,stop
g,reply_n,no you don't
f,check,so am i actually going to the peak of the wh-- white mountain
f,reply_y,to
g,clarify,you go one centimetre to the left of the peak same level as the peak and
f,check,wait a minute one centimetre to the left of the peak
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,right
