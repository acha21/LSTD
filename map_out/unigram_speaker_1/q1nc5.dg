f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,ready,right so
g,instruct,if you imagine
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,that you have to circle round the graveyard you know to the right-hand side below and then round
g,instruct,get that
f,uncodable,ehm
g,clarify,so you're like really going just about vertically along to the right you know to where you imagine the graveyard is and you're going round it but then you're you're going round it then you're ehm going to your right above the fast flow-- the fast flowing river
f,query_yn,am i am i going round and above the graveyard
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,you're going below the graveyard and above the fast flowing river
f,align,right okay
g,instruct,if you can imagine that know

g,query_yn,have you got an apache camp
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right

f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,towards the centre of the page though
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,to
f,check,just a straight line along
g,reply_n,no
g,clarify,this is a curve a forty-five degree line i would say you know like you're from the the bottom of the fast flowing river
g,align,right
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,you're maybe coming down about an inch and a half vertically
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then it sort of curves at a forty-five degree line
g,align,to the middle of the page you know in line with the apache camp i would say
f,align,okay done that
g,ready,right
f,explain,er see i've got i've got canoes kind of
g,query_w,where are they

g,instruct,more level
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,well
g,align,you're you're coming right sort of you're going round the top of the walled city
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,right so you've passed the apache pa-- you're above the apa-- apache camp and you're going round the top of the walled city
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,ready,right
g,instruct,and then you're sort of curving just curving basically it's kind of vertically you're going for a vertical kind of curve if you can say that for about maybe four inches down to you're coming down to about the bottom third of the page
f,query_yn,do you have a ghost town below
g,check,a ghost town
g,reply_n,no
f,reply_n,no
g,query_w,where's that where's the ghost town

f,acknowledge,yeah
g,ready,right
g,query_yn,and you've got a stone creek below
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,so you're sort of going in between the two
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,you're curving round 'til nearly you're nearly up at the flat rocks
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,your curve's going a way up
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,right
g,instruct,and then you're going vertically down again you should be maybe just less than an inch off the right-hand side of the page
g,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,do you have a saloon bar
g,query_w,where's that
f,reply_w,just underneath the flat rocks
g,reply_n,no
f,reply_n,no
g,explain,i've got a stone creek
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,and i i'm kind of above the stone creek at the moment
g,ready,have well have you
f,explain,haven't gone down yet wait a minute
g,reply_y,right
f,acknowledge,oh right okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,so you've to go past the flat rocks you know below but you've to go over 'til you're really about an inch the from right-hand side of the page
f,query_w,and down again
g,instruct,and then down again
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,query_w,how far down
g,reply_w,ehm take it
g,query_yn,have you got buffalo
f,reply_y,uh-huh

f,reply_n,no
f,explain,i don't
g,check,you haven't

g,ready,right so like
g,instruct,what you've really got to do is avoid the cattle ranch
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,which is really like in between the buffalo and the fort
g,instruct,so what you have to do is go r-- circle round the buffalo and then go above the cattle ranch if you can imagine it there
f,reply_y,right uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,instruct,do a bump it's in the centre of
f,acknowledge,right okay
