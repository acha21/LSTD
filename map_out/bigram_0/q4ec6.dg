f,reply_y,yes
g,instruct,slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the c-- the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that point
f,query_yn,so have you got a flight museum on your
g,reply_n,no
f,reply_n,no

f,clarify,mmhmm above the monastery
g,clarify,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve
f,check,so it's right round the monastery
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,reply_w,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden
f,uncodable,s--
g,instruct,roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it
g,instruct,then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,check,then to the right 'til the other side of the lef-- the alpine garden and straight up

g,query_yn,and do you have a telephone box
f,reply_y,yeah

f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,reply_w,well from that point that i've just gone round
g,check,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's
f,instruct,so vertical
f,query_yn,have you got level crossing
g,reply_n,no

g,explain,there's a v-- there's a hori-- horizontal line that goes under the telephone box
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right i've done that
g,instruct,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,explain,so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake
f,check,so i curve round that
g,reply_y,yes
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,to the middle of the east lake
g,explain,to a line approximately just it's below the m--
f,reply_y,yeah uh-huh
g,reply_w,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence
f,acknowledge,mm right
f,acknowledge,done that
g,instruct,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,check,so sorry say that again
g,reply_w,on a l-- eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer m-- the left most part of east lake
f,query_w,actually touches the
f,reply_n,no
