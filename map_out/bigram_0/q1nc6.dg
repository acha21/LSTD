f,check,well is this is this next to the
f,check,is it beside the old pine sort of or is it on a sort of
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,just draw a straight line down from the start four inches or so first of all
g,acknowledge,okay
g,check,you don't have a forge there but you know that's that's beneath the forge
f,check,where it is
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,right

g,instruct,don't go straight down take it right to the left-hand side of the page
f,reply_y,to the left-hand side right
f,explain,so it will be round the cave
