g,check,the slope
f,check,on the right-hand side
g,check,on the left-hand side
f,query_yn,the left
g,explain,by one centimetre
f,reply_w,but that's not sloping it should be
g,ready,well gentle sl-- very gentle slope
f,explain,so i'm now at the left-hand side of the bottom of the white mountain
g,instruct,er go along the side er away from the m-- white mountain by a-- from the s-- left side of a white mountain by about one centimetre
f,explain,am i to go up to the top of the mountain
g,reply_y,yeah
g,clarify,'til you reach the peak
g,check,stop
