f,ready,right
g,check,above the volcano and then down past it on the left
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then sort of down along the page straight along the bottom of the page
f,check,straight along about the same level as the volcano
g,query_yn,a bit below it a bit below it
g,explain,and then there's a there's a on mine there's a tribal settlement
g,acknowledge,right
f,explain,right i haven't got one of them

g,align,okay
f,ready,right
f,instruct,round the machete
g,reply_y,well i suppose so aye

g,clarify,that's you know what i mean it goes up to the middle of the page to above th-- the level of the saxon barn and then it goes across towards the left over the crevasse presumably and down between that and the saxon barn and then along under the saxon barn do you see what i mean
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,and once you get to the other side of the saxon barn underneath it you go down about an inch to avoid the pelicans
f,acknowledge,oh right
