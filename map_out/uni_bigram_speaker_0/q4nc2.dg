f,query_yn,is there anything between the mountain and what is parallel to the field station
g,reply_n,no there's absolutely nothing there
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,so i could just drop right down then
g,align,you can drop right down there yeah
f,acknowledge,okay
f,clarify,and just go on the same level then
g,instruct,go 'til you're down to the level with this field
g,acknowledge,station okay
f,acknowledge,field station okay then

g,reply_y,yeah that's right yeah
f,check,you don't want me to go across and up
g,instruct,no just straight just a diagonal line up to the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,okay then
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then a-- across the rope bridge to the right-hand side of the page
f,check,oh from the the top of the rope bridge or
g,reply_y,yeah across the top of the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,align,i've went and drawn this
