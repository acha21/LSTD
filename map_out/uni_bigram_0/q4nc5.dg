g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,it starts at start
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,reply_w,and it stops just horizontally from ravine but it stops down from start
g,align,do you know what i mean
f,check,stops horizontally from ravine
g,reply_y,uh-huh

f,query_w,and then whereabouts after that
g,clarify,you go down until just underneath
g,align,right see "p" of pine grove
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,just go down
f,check,so i-- i don't i'm going d-- d-- down the left-hand side of pine grove
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right
f,instruct,and to to the "p"
g,acknowledge,uh-huh okay
f,check,so i want to be right at the "p"
g,instruct,well sort of
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,clarify,about a centimetre away from it okay
f,acknowledge,right fine okay

f,explain,but if i if i just go in straight lines to to miss the things
g,acknowledge,okay then uh-huh yeah sure
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,if i go down to the top of the the concealed hideout and then straight along the top of the concealed hideout
f,align,is that right
