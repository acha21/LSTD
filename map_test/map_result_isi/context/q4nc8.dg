g,ready,okay
g,clarify,paul we're starting top left
f,acknowledge,right you've got a diamond mine
g,explain,i've got a diamond mine
f,align,okay
g,instruct,okay drop s-- straight down to the "d" of
f,acknowledge,right that's okay right okay right
g,acknowledge,okay
g,query_yn,this is very difficult
f,align,okay
g,instruct,drop drop straight straight down the side of the diamond mine to to the "d" of diamond mine
f,align,okay
f,check,just below it
g,reply_y,just below it yeah
f,acknowledge,pen's
g,clarify,and then you're going to go right drawing a line underneath diamond mine
f,explain,hold on hold on my pen's run out oh no it's working
g,instruct,okay you're going to draw you're going to underline diamond mine
f,align,underline it right
f,check,so right underline it along to the "e"
f,check,of diamond
g,check,und-- underline it un-- underline it along to the "e"
f,ready,pen's not working very well
g,align,okay
f,align,right
f,check,of highest viewpoint

g,reply_w,it's up slightly
f,reply_y,aye just slightly aye
g,acknowledge,okay right
f,check,a centimetre up
g,query_w,right what what you've got to do here is you've got to drop down towards the safari truck
f,align,y-- okay
f,query_w,which side of the safari truck
g,instruct,ehm drop down 'til until you're
g,ready,right wait a minute let me see
f,query_w,towards the right-hand side of it or towards
g,explain,the the safari truck i think it it looks like a steering wheel on the right-hand side
f,acknowledge,the right-hand side
g,align,can you see it
f,query_yn,is it sort of handlebar type thing
g,align,right see the see the right-hand see the right-hand wheel
f,reply_y,yes
g,reply_w,drop down towards that
f,ready,right okay but
g,reply_w,and and stop just just above the safari truck

g,clarify,round the top
f,check,so quite a quite a long line
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,round the top
