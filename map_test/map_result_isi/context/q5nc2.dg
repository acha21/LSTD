g,clarify,moving slightly forwards and down to the right to the left
f,check,slightly forward and then to the left
g,reply_y,yes
g,check,and downwards
g,reply_w,'til you come to about level the bottom of the stony desert
f,align,right
f,acknowledge,straight down
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,and then to the left
g,ready,well
g,reply_y,sort of yeah uh-huh
g,reply_w,downwards to the left
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,then keep progressing along to the left
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,reply_w,about four inches
f,reply_w,four inches
g,reply_y,yeah
g,uncodable,ehm
f,query_w,ehm is it straight down from the waterhole where you want me to go
g,reply_w,ehm it doesn't actually say here
f,align,so right you want me to go four inches along then right
g,reply_y,yeah uh-huh
f,align,okay
g,uncodable,ehm
g,query_yn,and round the next obstacle
g,explain,it's a plane crash
f,acknowledge,mm
g,check,up up sort of straight up
f,check,straight up
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,for about three inches
f,align,okay
g,ready,then
g,check,turn to the right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,query_w,how far
g,clarify,a-- to about the middle of the page just r-- round the next obstacle
f,check,round it
g,reply_y,yes round the top of it
f,align,round the top okay
g,reply_w,to about the middle of the page
f,instruct,mm wait a minute
f,explain,if i'm going to go round it i'll not but i won't get to the top of the page the middle of the page
g,uncodable,oh ehm
f,acknowledge,i'll go round it right
g,clarify,just just go round it
f,align,okay
f,check,halfway round
g,reply_y,yeah
f,query_w,or all the way
f,uncodable,ha--
g,reply_n,don't no don't go all the way round it
g,acknowledge,go
f,acknowledge,halfway right halfway round
g,instruct,go along the top and then at the other side ehm go downwards but still sloping for about an inch downwards but still sloping slightly to the left
f,reply_w,and and sloping to the left
g,ready,well
g,clarify,just as if you were going d-- if you as if you were walking down a hill
f,acknowledge,right okay right right that's it
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,and then ehm still heading in the le-- towards the left
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,clarify,but a very very slight slope upwards for about three inches but just a small one
f,clarify,i'm going to end up tracing my path back if i do go to the left
g,ready,well
g,acknowledge,don't go
g,query_w,have you g-- d-- how far down have you gone
g,reply_w,don't go too far down
f,align,right
f,reply_w,i'm not even halfway up
g,acknowledge,uh-huh no i know
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,that's okay
f,check,i'm sort of stuck in between a waterhole and a savannah
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,ready,well
g,check,don't don't go as far along as the savannah
g,instruct,just before you get to the front of the s-- in-- just before you get to the savannah slope upwards
f,check,slope up straight line up
g,reply_y,yeah
g,clarify,almost a straight line just about four inches to the mountain
f,check,to the mountain
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,check,up to the top of the mountain
g,acknowledge,yeah
g,clarify,stop the line at opposite the top of the mountain
f,clarify,opposite the top of the mountain
g,acknowledge,yeah just at the top
f,align,just at right okay
f,check,it's sort of parallel to the white mountain as well
g,reply_w,it's at it's the slate mountain
g,acknowledge,yeah just
g,clarify,sort of go up
f,acknowledge,uh-huh uh-huh right okay
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,right i'm there
g,instruct,and once you get to the top of the mountain turn to the left again
f,acknowledge,left
f,check,just round the sort of round rocks
g,check,ehm b-- between the the hot wells and the mountain to the left and down between the two
g,reply_y,well yeah
f,explain,mm it's hot springs i've got here and then white mountain
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,align,right
f,check,so i'm at the top of the white mountain just up
g,reply_n,not the white mountain
g,reply_w,the slate mountain
f,ready,well
f,align,put it this way i'm at the left of some mou-- i'm now opposite some mountain
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right okay ehm
g,acknowledge,right okay ehm
g,align,so where are you at the moment if you if you
f,query_yn,opposite a white mountain the top of the white mountain
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,check,ehm under are you g-- g-- down the side of the mountain 'til you're underneath the hot wells
f,align,okay
f,ready,ins-- un-- well
f,explain,i don't have hot wells i have hot springs
f,align,right i'm coming down the mountain right
g,align,okay
f,query_w,so where do you want me to go when i come down this mountain
g,uncodable,ehm
g,check,go down to the right of the hot wells the hot springs
f,reply_w,to the right of it
f,acknowledge,right
f,reply_w,i've actually
g,reply_w,and underneath it and underneath it
f,reply_w,and underneath it right i've done that
g,align,right you underneath it now
f,reply_y,yes
g,acknowledge,right okay ehm
g,clarify,heading towards the left go down about an inch t-- a slope
f,clarify,heading towards the left
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,query_yn,you want me to have is it a diagonal slope
g,reply_w,ehm yeah almost
f,align,right
f,acknowledge,an inch just an inch
g,reply_y,yeah mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,ready,and then ehm
g,instruct,curve the bottom and start heading up towards the white mountain
f,acknowledge,right okay right
g,instruct,ehm head fairly close to the side of the white mountain
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,just keep going up 'til you get to the top of the white mountain
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,explain,i'm at the top
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,when you're at the top go straight up for two and a half inches absolutely straight
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,ready,and then
g,clarify,start heading towards the lake
f,query_w,for how far along
g,reply_w,ehm about three inches
f,align,okay
g,reply_w,towards it
g,align,are y-- are you at it now
f,explain,i'm at the lake
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,go round the outside of the lake ah
f,query_w,which way up or down
g,check,go up
f,align,okay
g,check,and round it
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,in an a clockwise direction and but don't go right round it go
f,check,halfway round
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,when you get to the go between the lake and the roman baths

f,acknowledge,right
g,check,go round as if you were heading back to where you started going round the lake
f,explain,i'm halfway round the lake
g,acknowledge,right
g,ready,well
g,instruct,go down to the bottom half of the lake but ehm start straightening out as if you were going back to where you started but le-- leave about an inch between the path where you went round the lake and the path where you're coming out of it
f,check,you want me to trace back my steps
g,reply_n,no
g,align,you've gone halfway round the lake
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,go down the sort of slightly flat side the the side that's about an inch of the lake f-- just follow that down
f,check,i don't have a flat side
g,acknowledge,oh dear
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right okay
f,align,i'm at the bottom of the lake
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,you're at the bottom
f,align,right
f,explain,well i'm
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,keep progressing in that kind of line for about another inch and a half
f,reply_w,towards the left
g,reply_y,yes
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,now
g,clarify,when you've done that you should be ehm about equal with where you started going round the lake but about an inch and a half down from there

f,acknowledge,yeah
g,uncodable,ehm
g,query_yn,and go underneath them
f,acknowledge,underneath them
g,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,ehm go go down 'til you're past them and then turn to the right
f,align,to the right okay
f,query_w,how far along to the right do you want me to go
g,reply_w,about two inches
f,align,okay
g,explain,and that's the finish
f,acknowledge,okay
