g,explain,do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the bottom
g,align,right
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,clarify,so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the bottom
f,check,the bottom of the page
g,acknowledge,right
f,query_w,oh wait a minute wh-- fr-- how many centimetres from the w--
f,acknowledge,oh right
g,clarify,about one centimetre from the left-hand side of the page

g,reply_w,if you aim above that for about six centimetres right
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,a point up there
f,acknowledge,uh-huh

g,check,one centimetre to the right o--
g,explain,i think that's o-- pff
f,explain,but i suppose ehm i suppose if i draw a line from that wee house it might just miss the flight museum
g,reply_w,right well what you're doing is you're drawing a line it's not exactly eh east right it's sort of between two and three o'clock it's very very gradual incline up for about fourteen centimetres twelve
f,instruct,right i n-- i know what i know what what you're doing

g,instruct,eh what you're doing now is you're going along to the right just above the top of the alpine garden whatever those if that's weeds or something eh you're going along for two to three centimetres
g,align,okay
g,reply_y,uh-huh to the right uh-huh
f,check,right so i'm going to the right of the alpine garden a-- the top of it
g,align,the top just straight across right

g,align,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,you're on the right-hand side of it
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,then all you're doing is going up for about another three centimetres to just just above the top of the telephone box
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,about half a centimetre above the top of the telephone box
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,now this is where you've not got a thatched mud hut
f,acknowledge,oh

g,instruct,eh well what you're wanting to do is you see the bottom of the east lake the the line that's going down sort of diagonally sort of
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,reply_w,the bottom right-hand corner
g,align,well you're wanting see the "k" of lake
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,clarify,you're wanting to end up just about half a centimetre away from the bottom of the lake itself but underneath the letter "k"
g,align,right
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,check,but don't draw a straight diagonal line
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,align,because you want to from where you are just now you're above the telephone box that right
f,reply_y,uh-huh i'm above the telephone box
g,instruct,you're wanting to sort of go it's a sort of curve aiming to the left and then going straight north
g,align,do you know what i mean it's like th-- the left-hand side of a "u" or something like that right
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,you're at the bottom of
f,query_yn,have y-- have you got this le--

f,acknowledge,right okay
g,check,eh so you're
f,query_w,so whe-- whereabouts is this mud m-- m-- m-- this thatched mud hut
g,explain,mu-- thatched mud hut it's directly above the telephone box at the moment
g,instruct,so that's what you're trying to avoid if you can imagine a thatched mud hut sort of halfway between the telephone box and the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake
f,align,right
f,check,so i'm wanting to go left
g,clarify,right you're sort of going left
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,clarify,and then north up to just below the "k" but on the don't go into the lake just stay outside it
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,do you sort of see where i'm going
f,acknowledge,i kind of right i see that's that there right
f,acknowledge,i know you're going
g,query_yn,so you should have a sort of a "u" shape there
f,explain,but i've got this stupid level crossing
g,reply_w,oh forget it oh you can go-- you can walk across that
f,acknowledge,right i'll just go up this side of it right
g,acknowledge,right
f,explain,i think i've missed it
g,acknowledge,right okay

g,acknowledge,right that's right
f,explain,i'm not in the lake though
g,acknowledge,that's right
g,align,just you know the bottom of the lake it's sort of going diagonally
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,follow that the bottom of the lake right up keep about half a centimetre away from it and follow it up to the left
g,acknowledge,right
g,query_w,to the bottom corner of the lake the pointy bit
g,align,see it
g,query_yn,have you got a pointy bit
f,check,oh right this i-- this is to the left this is towards the parked van
g,check,yes this is t-- aiming towards the parked van
f,acknowledge,right okay right okay
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,so you're right under the bottom corner at the moment
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and just continue that line for about another centimetre and that's the finish just in the exact same
f,clarify,just below that wee bump
g,explain,that's be-- just below the wee bump that's it
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,exactly
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,and that's it
f,acknowledge,ah
g,acknowledge,that's it very good
f,reply_n,no problem
g,explain,that was that was a lot easier than the one with neil i'll tell you that
f,explain,we're a team
