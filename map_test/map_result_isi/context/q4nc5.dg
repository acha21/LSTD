g,acknowledge,right
g,align,it starts at start
g,align,right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,reply_w,and it stops just horizontally from ravine but it stops down from start
g,align,do you know what i mean
f,reply_w,stops horizontally from ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,clarify,it's just on line with ravine but it's like just a curvy line and you stop just where you started
g,query_yn,do you know what i mean it doesn't make sense does it

g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,uncodable,a--
g,align,okay
f,query_w,and then whereabouts after that
g,check,you go down until just underneath
g,align,right see "p" of pine grove
f,reply_y,yeah
g,clarify,just go down
f,check,so i-- i don't i'm going d-- d-- down the left-hand side of pine grove
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right
f,check,and to to the "p"
g,acknowledge,uh-huh okay
f,check,so i want to be right at the "p"
g,query_w,well sort of
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,align,about a centimetre away from it okay
f,acknowledge,right fine okay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh right ehm
g,query_w,where you've got something else haven't you underneath the pine grove
f,reply_w,i've got an avalanche

f,query_yn,which is a bit over to the right-hand side
g,reply_w,and down
f,reply_y,uh-huh
f,reply_y,yeah
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,okay well and you've got the concealed hideout
f,reply_y,yeah i've got that
g,clarify,well draw a line so you miss out the avalanche
f,check,sti-- am i going round to the right o-- s-- hand side of the avalan-- the concealed hid-- hideout
g,ready,ehm right
f,query_w,where do i want to go in relation to the concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,you miss out
g,align,right see in the line
g,instruct,v-- you miss out you put the concealed hideout to your right and
g,instruct,no wait a minute wait a minute
g,clarify,you put the avalanche to the right of your line and the concealed hideout to the left of your line
f,check,so i've got to go down to the top of the concealed hideout and then across to the right
g,uncodable,eh
f,align,that be right
g,align,see it's a curvy line
g,explain,i don't know how i could describe this
f,reply_w,but if i if i just go in straight lines to to miss the things
g,acknowledge,okay then uh-huh yeah sure
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,instruct,if i go down to the top of the the concealed hideout and then straight along the top of the concealed hideout
f,align,is that right
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,check,so i
g,acknowledge,and you're missing out
f,clarify,so i miss the bottom of the avalanche i'm going underneath the avalanche
g,acknowledge,right that's good
f,acknowledge,okay
g,clarify,so it's not involved in your line like it's to the right of
f,align,it's to the right of it's to the right of the line yeah
g,reply_y,your line yeah that's good and right
g,clarify,so draw round the concealed hideout 'cause it's actually in your line you know what i mean it's to the r-- to the left of your line
g,align,do you know what i mean
f,reply_w,so i've got to go i've got to go down past the concealed hideout

f,explain,i've got one and it's on the right-hand side of the page
f,reply_w,ehm which
g,query_yn,is it just below concealed hideout
f,reply_w,it's it's directly it's it's directly below the "t" of concealed hideout
g,reply_w,quite a bit down
f,reply_w,ehm not that far it's about wh-- i don't know
g,query_w,how many
f,reply_w,four or five centimetres five centimetres maybe
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,explain,well i've got another one
g,acknowledge,right
g,explain,i've got one that's ehm
g,acknowledge,right
g,explain,it's to the left of the concealed hideout about a centimetre down
g,align,okay
f,ready,so
g,ready,and it's like ehm
f,reply_w,is it in the curvy bay bit
g,query_w,in the what
f,align,see the curvy bay see where it says crane bay and there's a big curve
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,query_yn,is it in that bit
g,reply_w,no it's up it's
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,it's just on the same level as the concealed hideout
f,reply_w,it's on the same level
f,reply_w,below
g,reply_w,same well kind of it's just like a centimetre down
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,right okay i think
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,so what you do is right you know how you've got crane bay
