g,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,you've got a cross marked start
f,reply_y,yes
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,if you just want to come like down past the extinct volcano down to like to towards the bottom of the page
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,check,just straight down directly south
g,reply_y,uh-huh just straight down
g,reply_y,uh south
f,query_w,how far
g,query_w,south down to about equal to where the tribal settlement is further on
f,align,equal to where the tribal settlement is
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,just a wee bit below it because you're going to go start going ehm west you
g,check,y-- you've not got a t--
f,explain,i've no g-- i've not got any tribal settlement at all and other than that i've got an extinct volcano and that's heading down towards

f,check,the bottom of the page
g,check,you've not got to the left-hand side a tribal settlement
f,reply_n,no i haven't
g,instruct,well you're going to go down about three centimetres down to where it the word says extinct volcano
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,okay
g,clarify,then you're going to start going along west
f,acknowledge,west right okay for
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,keep on going until you're maybe about three centimetres from the the left-hand side of the page
f,clarify,from the left-hand s--
f,explain,that's quite a bit
g,reply_y,uh-huh it's quite far along
g,align,'kay
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,reply_w,so just about three in-- three centimetres from the left-hand side

g,check,just going up then veering off to the right up to the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,'kay
g,check,then you're going to go across the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,reply_y,uh-huh

g,clarify,you're going to go through that
f,align,okay
g,acknowledge,right
f,check,the end of the rope bridge
g,check,you're at the end of the rope bridge
g,instruct,now if you go down not very steeply but just ehm down south a bit
f,acknowledge,down right
g,clarify,about about another three centimetres just a gradual slope down
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,clarify,gradual sort of south through east
g,reply_y,uh-huh slope to the east
g,reply_w,aye south to east slope down about three centimetres
f,align,okay
g,acknowledge,right

f,clarify,right i'll be underneath it by about two or three centimetres
g,acknowledge,uh-huh just a little below the "o" actually
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,then you're going to start going up north again
f,align,okay
g,instruct,and put your line through the "o"
f,align,okay
g,instruct,and you're going to go up there for about about ehm let me see about ten centimetres up
f,align,okay
f,reply_w,past the crevasse on the right on the left

f,acknowledge,right okay
f,clarify,dir-- just directly down
f,check,straight down
g,clarify,just directly down
f,check,to the secret valley
g,reply_w,uh-huh just to the bottom of the where it says secret valley
