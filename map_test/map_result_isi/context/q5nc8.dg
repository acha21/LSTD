g,ready,right
f,reply_y,aye
g,align,do you see the start point above the stony desert
f,reply_y,aye
g,instruct,ehm heading towards the left for about two centimetres 'til you reach s-- above a-- equal to the end of the stony desert
f,acknowledge,aye right
g,reply_w,ehm then start sloping downwards to the left
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,towards the bottom so you should be about an inch from the top from the bottom of the page
f,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,ehm
g,query_yn,do you see the site of the plane crash
f,reply_n,no
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,oh yeah i do
f,acknowledge,right up at the top
g,acknowledge,oh
g,reply_n,no no
f,explain,no you must have another one
g,acknowledge,right okay ehm
g,instruct,he-- keep heading towards the le-- in a straight line towards the l-- the left of the page 'til you're about ehm an inch and a half away from the the left the far left-hand side of the page
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,and then start sloping up
g,align,do you see the collapsed shelter
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,ready,right ehm
g,instruct,if you start sloping upwards slightly towards the right 'til you're about parallel with the top of the collapsed shelter but still oh about an inch and a half from the left-hand side of the page
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,so that should be about three and a half inches
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,so then start heading towards the right of the page ehm over the top of the collapsed shelter about three inches
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,ehm so you should be just at about the end of the collapsed shelter
f,reply_y,aye
g,instruct,right so go down to just down the side of the the down the right-hand side of the collapsed shelter 'til you're equal with about the bottom of it
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,now
g,query_yn,do you see the savannah
f,reply_y,aye
g,ready,right ehm
g,clarify,it should be about if you s-- a slight slope upwards to the bottom of the savannah it should be about three inches
f,reply_y,aye
g,acknowledge,right
g,check,so if you just head up towards the bottom of the savannah
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,not underneath it though
g,uncodable,ehm
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right mm
g,align,do you see the slate mountain
f,reply_n,no
g,reply_n,no ehm never mind
g,instruct,ehm once you get to the side of the s-- head up the left-hand side of the savannah about four inches
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,ehm now about an inch and a half back to the left
f,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,ehm do you see the hot wells
f,query_yn,hot springs
g,reply_y,hot springs yeah
f,reply_y,aye
g,instruct,ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of d-- if you slope towards the bottom in a d-- uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line
f,acknowledge,aye right
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,and now go to the left about an inch just un-- so that you're going under the hot wells
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,then
g,instruct,another sort of diagonal slope downwards but ehm slightly steeper than forty-five degree line
f,reply_y,aye
g,instruct,forty-five degrees for about an inch
f,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,ehm
g,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,then ehm
g,align,do you see the white mountain
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,well you want to curve up towards it but making where from where you are now so that it looks like the bottom of a basin curving up to the side of the white mountains it's about six or seven inches maybe not as much as that
f,acknowledge,right i think so
f,query_w,where is it i need to end up the left or the right side of the white mountain
g,reply_w,ehm the left
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,mm
g,check,so go up the left-hand side of the mountain as if you were climbing it
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,and then ehm
g,clarify,head upwards straight in a straight line to about two and a half inches
f,check,past the round rocks
g,reply_w,ehm well yeah i don't have that so
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,just keep going straight up
g,align,ehm uh do you see the lake
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,if you start heading towards the lake in a straight line about three in-- just about three inches 'til you get to the the edge of the lake
g,clarify,then you're going round the lake in a clockwise direction
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,but not right round it
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,query_yn,do you see the roman baths
f,reply_n,nope
g,reply_n,no eh never mind
g,clarify,ehm just come round the lake and then as if you were heading back to the left-hand side of the page but but just if you just stop where you're parallel to where you started going round the lake about an inch down from there
f,acknowledge,ah right aye right got you
g,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,and then do you see the where the antelopes are
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,if you just head down about three or four inches straight down and go down the left-hand side of them
f,reply_w,the left-hand side
g,reply_y,yeah
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,clarify,just keep going straight down
g,ready,and then
g,check,so you should be just underneath the antelope
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,uncodable,then just
g,instruct,go in a straight line towards the right about two inches and that's your finishing point
f,align,right
f,acknowledge,that's it
g,reply_y,yeah
