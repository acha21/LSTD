f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,reply_w,and just stop there
g,ready,right ehm
g,align,you know how there's local residents there
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,well see where you've stopped
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,align,just go to the right
f,check,round the side of it yeah
g,acknowledge,uh-huh just to the right
g,instruct,and then stop a couple of centimetres after crane bay
g,ready,now ehm
g,query_yn,have you got a forked stream yeah
f,reply_w,yeah i've got a forked stream
f,acknowledge,right down gurgling

g,reply_y,uh-huh to the right
f,clarify,so over the river then
g,reply_n,ehm no hang on
f,explain,i'm at i'm at the left of the of the stream going down
g,acknowledge,oh right right sorry
g,align,ehm you're supposed to be at the right
g,uncodable,ehm
f,instruct,oh i'm supposed to right i'm supposed to go over the river then
g,reply_n,no
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,go back to where the groove in crane bay is
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,right
g,query_yn,ehm now did you go along to the right yeah
f,align,i went to the right
f,check,and down past the side of the local residents you know between that and the river
g,acknowledge,oh right right oh right sorry ehm

f,check,and then down
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,down
g,query_w,down to where it divides
f,query_w,down to where it divides
g,reply_w,to the right of it
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,align,right okay i'm there now
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,right and ehm
g,check,you're going to have to like curve out to the right as though there's something there
g,reply_w,'cause i've got farmed land here so
f,acknowledge,right
g,query_w,curve out have to ehm
f,align,is it a sort of straight line out or just a you know to the right or s-- just curved lands out
g,reply_w,eh just sloping very slightly
g,check,downwards
f,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,very slightly ehm
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_w,curve out about five six centimetres
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and curve round and then ehm go straight along to the bottom of the dead tree
f,check,so curve round and then straight along to the bottom
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,query_yn,of the dead tree
f,align,right
f,align,i'm still on the right-hand side of the river is that right
g,ready,uh well
g,align,you've curved out towards the right so you're like in the middle of the river now kind of thing where the dead tree is at the bottom of that
f,align,right
f,explain,i'm right in the middle of the river
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,query_yn,at the bottom of dead tree
f,acknowledge,right
