f,check,how far down the page am i now
f,align,okay
g,instruct,ten centimetres
f,check,east
f,clarify,i just keep going east
g,acknowledge,east
g,clarify,to about couple centimetres off the top off the end of the hills
f,reply_y,we've probably got different hills
f,instruct,okay that's me
g,ready,and
g,acknowledge,then curve upwards
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,back to the stream to where you c-- to where you cross the stream
f,acknowledge,this big thing

g,align,at the top
f,reply_y,yeah
g,uncodable,uh
g,ready,right
g,check,and you've got like the two bits round two lines round crane bay
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,so you cross that go up go back up and cross that
f,check,how far down the river bit
g,clarify,about two centimetres from where the two lines meet more sort of come into one
f,check,describe what you've got

f,explain,but i thought we're starting at the top
g,acknowledge,yeah i know
f,instruct,follow the stream to the fork
g,acknowledge,list-- i know this is me explaining what i've got

f,check,so way out to m-- east
g,clarify,way out 'til about
g,ready,yeah
g,reply_w,to about two centimetres off the end the page
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,then about four centimetres down
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,and then back in again
f,explain,about in line with this dead tree
g,clarify,so you're just below the dead tree
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and then you cross the stream so's that you are actually below the dead tree
