f,acknowledge,right
f,ready,and then
g,instruct,and then up
g,clarify,you know how there's a a wee kind of groove in crane bay then it goes down towards the forked stream
f,reply_y,yeah
g,reply_y,if you go up to there
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,and just stop there
g,ready,right ehm
g,align,you know how there's local residents there
f,reply_y,yeah
g,ready,right
g,align,well see where you've stopped
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,just go to the right
f,reply_y,round the side of it yeah
g,reply_y,uh-huh just to the right
g,instruct,and then stop a couple of centimetres after crane bay
g,uncodable,now ehm
g,query_yn,have you got a forked stream yeah
f,reply_y,yeah i've got a forked stream

f,reply_n,no i've not got anything no
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,well if you just ehm curve out about five centimetres from where you've stopped
f,query_yn,to the right
g,reply_y,uh-huh to the right
f,check,so over the river then
g,reply_n,ehm no hang on
f,explain,i'm at i'm at the left of the of the stream going down
g,acknowledge,oh right right sorry
g,instruct,ehm you're supposed to be at the right
g,uncodable,ehm
f,explain,oh i'm supposed to right i'm supposed to go over the river then
g,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,go back to where the groove in crane bay is
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,query_yn,ehm now did you go along to the right yeah
f,acknowledge,i went to the right
f,instruct,and down past the side of the local residents you know between that and the river
g,acknowledge,oh right right oh right sorry ehm
f,align,right
g,instruct,no you were supposed to go past the river a few centimetres out of the river so that you were to the right of it
f,acknowledge,right okay i'm to the right of the i'm to the right of the river
f,ready,and then down
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,clarify,down
g,query_w,down to where it divides
f,query_w,down to where it divides
g,reply_w,to the right of it
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,acknowledge,right okay i'm there now
f,ready,right
g,ready,right and ehm
g,instruct,you're going to have to like curve out to the right as though there's something there
g,explain,'cause i've got farmed land here so
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,curve out have to ehm
f,align,is it a sort of straight line out or just a you know to the right or s-- just curved lands out
g,reply_w,eh just sloping very slightly
g,clarify,downwards
f,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,very slightly ehm
f,ready,right
g,instruct,curve out about five six centimetres
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and curve round and then ehm go straight along to the bottom of the dead tree
f,check,so curve round and then straight along to the bottom
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,check,of the dead tree
f,acknowledge,right
f,align,i'm still on the right-hand side of the river is that right
g,ready,uh well
g,align,you've curved out towards the right so you're like in the middle of the river now kind of thing where the dead tree is at the bottom of that
f,acknowledge,right
f,align,i'm right in the middle of the river
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,check,at the bottom of dead tree
f,acknowledge,right

g,acknowledge,oh right
g,uncodable,ehm now
g,instruct,see if you go from the tip of the lagoon and uh down to the left but you'll need to curve out a bit as though
g,explain,'cause i've got a rock fall there
f,acknowledge,so
g,ready,so
f,check,i w-- i want to curve out to the left
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,clarify,eh heading heading for where the top of green bay
g,query_yn,eh right
g,instruct,you know how where there's ehm
g,query_yn,let me see
g,align,know how where sandy shore is that line towards the left
f,reply_y,uh-huh
f,reply_y,yeah
g,check,it comes right down to the bottom forms a tip
g,instruct,if you go to there

g,instruct,and then along a few centimetres to the right just to the t-- ehm left of the pirate ship and that's where it finishes
f,acknowledge,straight down a few centimetres to the right right
f,explain,i've got computer controlled sub that i better
g,acknowledge,uh-huh right
f,instruct,avoid
f,query_w,and i finish at the left of the pirate ship
g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,align,right
f,check,at the bottom
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right that's it
