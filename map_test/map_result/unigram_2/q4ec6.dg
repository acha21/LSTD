f,check,so it's right round the monastery
g,reply_y,yeah
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden
f,acknowledge,s--
g,clarify,roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it
g,clarify,then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden

f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,right i've done that
g,instruct,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,check,so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake
f,acknowledge,so i curve round that
g,reply_y,yes
f,acknowledge,right

f,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,explain,so sorry say that again
g,clarify,on a l-- eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence
