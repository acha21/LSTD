g,align,right you start at the top left
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,ready,eh right
g,align,right you've got cliffs to the right so you sort of slope down towards the "c" of cliffs
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,right

g,align,right
f,ready,right
g,instruct,and that's directly underneath the cliffs so it if
g,reply_y,yeah
f,check,so i go below that and round underneath the bottom of the pine tree
g,check,so just pretend there's a a forge
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,but it's like but to the left of the pine tree and below the cliffs right so it's like a loop
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,align,okay
g,instruct,so you're ending up just like to the left of the old pine tree
f,check,i'm directly under the "b" of green bay
f,check,up here
g,explain,oh it's upside down
g,instruct,my crane bay's at the bottom right
f,explain,green bay i s-- green bay i said

f,reply_w,towar-- i don't go round it i've i i don't go above it
g,reply_n,no no
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,just keep the pine forest at it outwith it

g,align,right
g,align,so like you've got to eventually right see from the "p" of the pine forest you're going to go out in a sort of wee lump like a nose
f,check,round the bakery
g,reply_y,no
g,instruct,but right first before you come to the bakery do another wee lump
f,query_w,why
g,reply_w,'cause i say
f,query_w,away what am i avoiding
g,reply_n,nothing
g,instruct,just that's where the route goes

f,acknowledge,right
g,align,right
g,explain,right i've got a canal there
g,query_yn,have you
f,acknowledge,right
f,reply_n,no
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,align,right see after your two centimetres you should be above
g,query_yn,have you got crane bay
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,above the "e" in crane bay
f,acknowledge,oh well i'm miles above that right
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,so you go down towards "e"
f,acknowledge,right

g,ready,well i have right
g,instruct,so just go down
g,query_yn,have you got a w-- rocket warehouse
f,reply_y,uh-huh

f,acknowledge,oh right
g,check,right a wee diagonal line there
g,instruct,and then you go horizontally across the top of the rocket warehouse
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,to just to the edge of the rocket warehouse
