g,align,see the diamond mine up there
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,ready,right well
g,query_yn,see we just go to the top left of it just sort of near the sort of square on its end right
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,at the diamond mine right
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,just sort of up to the top left of that you start up there
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right
g,check,just right next to the diamond mi-- mine
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,there's a big cross right
g,query_yn,is there a cross there
f,reply_y,aye
g,acknowledge,oh right
g,instruct,so you just go down the diamond mine
g,acknowledge,right
f,check,down
g,reply_w,just down ss--
g,instruct,and follow it round it's sort of a square round the diamond mine
f,clarify,what draw a l-- a line round the diamond
g,instruct,just sort of head it down
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,from the the the cross right
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,you go straight down
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,to level with the sort of diamond mine writing
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,right in there when you're just below it just go right over to your right
g,acknowledge,right
g,check,and then stop under springboks
g,acknowledge,right
f,explain,springboks

f,reply_w,overgrown gully
g,acknowledge,oh right i understand this now
g,instruct,well go over about sort of eh oh just over half the pa-- un-- just under half the width of the paper from the diamond mine
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,then stop
g,instruct,and then sort of go up
f,query_w,how far
g,check,eh sort of near the top of the page
g,instruct,then stop
g,instruct,and then go over to your right
f,acknowledge,right

f,check,straight left like
g,reply_y,aye
g,check,just sort of straight left
f,query_w,so where do i
g,reply_w,so you should be about oh two inches off the left of the paper
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then go down
f,check,straight down
g,check,aye straight down
g,clarify,about a third to the height of the paper
f,align,so i'm two thirds of the way down now

f,clarify,my right
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,query_w,how far
