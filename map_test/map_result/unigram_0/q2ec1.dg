f,reply_y,yeah
f,reply_w,the very opposite corner of iron bridge
g,reply_w,i don't have iron bridge
f,acknowledge,okay

g,acknowledge,okay
g,clarify,go over the bridge
f,reply_y,okay i'm over the bridge
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,now follow the line of the river right down to the fork
f,clarify,to the dead tree
g,clarify,just above the dead tree before the fork
f,acknowledge,okay i'm there
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,now i want you to go to your left and do a sort of "c" quite a a wide "c" round some supposed

f,query_yn,have i got to cross this babbling brook cross it
g,reply_n,not again
g,check,you've cross it further down you've got to do a wide "c" just above the fork do a wide "c" so that you're coming across the river at b-- you know underneath the dead tree
f,check,i'm coming
f,acknowledge,oh right i see okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,under the dead tree go directly south for about five maybe seven centimetres
f,explain,to the treasure
g,explain,i don't have that

f,instruct,it's in the middle like it comes out in between the two of them
g,acknowledge,oh heck
g,explain,your river's different from mine
f,instruct,you want to you want my path to be a large enough "c" so as it goes down
g,check,it and it crosses over the the mountain stream and then goes directly south underneath the dead tree is
g,check,is the dead tree in between the fork
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,right
f,ready,right maybe so
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,so you're going south then see i come to the lagoon then when i go south and then i go left which would me-- mean you going right

g,query_yn,do the do a "c" so that it
f,ready,right i've not crossed
