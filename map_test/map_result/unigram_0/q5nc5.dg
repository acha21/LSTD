g,check,just down at the side just straight down
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and then go round in a curve underneath the diamond mine
f,acknowledge,right mm
g,instruct,then you want to start like carry on that curve for about f-- four or five inches just gradually heading up the way
g,acknowledge,right
f,check,so i'm making a curve round the diamond mine yeah
g,reply_n,no no no no
