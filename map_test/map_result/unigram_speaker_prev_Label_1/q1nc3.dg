f,reply_w,eh the fast running creek is at the top right-hand side of the page beside diamond mine
f,reply_n,no
g,query_yn,the diamond mine is that on the right-hand side of your page
f,reply_w,it's the left-hand side
g,acknowledge,ah
g,query_yn,the fast flowing river is at the top
f,reply_y,right
g,explain,right that's i've got that

f,query_w,right so w-- anyway so at the diamond mine right
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,check,and i have to curve underneath
g,reply_y,curve underneath
f,check,start go down come underneath the diamond mine
g,query_yn,have you got s-- see between the fast flowing river and the diamond mine have you got anything
f,reply_n,nope
f,query_yn,got canoes
g,ready,right so
g,explain,i've got a graveyard there
f,acknowledge,right i see
f,query_w,whereabouts is that

f,reply_y,s-- right
f,check,so where've i to go have i to go round that graveyard or something
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,check,you've to miss the graveyard so if you
g,clarify,right you've curved round right
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,explain,i've g-- right i mean that i i'm still at diamond mine so i'm not sure where to go
g,ready,so
g,instruct,if you go o--
g,instruct,well just start slightly going up the way
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,ready,and right
f,check,to the fast running creek
g,explain,imagine there's a graveyard
g,align,right
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,ready,right
g,instruct,just in the centre of the diamond mine
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,and the fast flowing river just imagine that
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,and you j-- you're going round that you're going round the graveyard

f,acknowledge,right right okay
g,ready,so
f,query_w,so where are we now
f,check,so i've to go round
f,query_w,but where am i going after that
g,reply_y,if mmhmm
f,explain,i've got to know where i'm going this is it
g,check,you've to you're going round the top of the fast flowing river after you've avoided the graveyard
f,reply_y,right
f,check,and i curve right round the fast flowing river then
g,reply_y,uh-huh mmhmm
f,check,where to
g,ready,well right
g,instruct,you go round
g,ready,then
f,query_yn,have you got canoes

g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,it's just above that it's about a couple of inches but up above that
g,acknowledge,yeah that's right
g,instruct,so if you like c-- curve round the
f,check,apache camp
g,reply_n,no
g,clarify,don't curve round it j--
g,align,just you're going m-- forty-five degree angle eh towards the bottom eh left of the page you're going that way you know
f,reply_y,towards the walled city
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,so i'm going round
g,clarify,and you're going round the outside of the walled city
f,query_w,on what s-- on what side
g,clarify,you're going round the top of the walled city and round the left of it on the left-hand side
f,acknowledge,so
f,check,and that's at an angle of forty-five degrees
g,reply_n,no
f,acknowledge,right i see right
g,reply_n,no
f,check,so from the walled city to where i am just there it's at a forty-five degree angle to where i just wa-- came from
f,align,right see where the fast running creek is right
g,reply_y,yes
f,check,i've just come down a couple of inches
g,clarify,you've come down about one and a half inches
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,ready,right so
g,instruct,if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city
f,acknowledge,erm
g,instruct,that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page
g,ready,right
f,check,so i should be around the middle of the page
f,acknowledge,see where i am just now right
g,reply_n,no not the mi-- the centre no not
f,explain,i've come i've come round the top of the fast running creek
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,explain,so i'm really i'd be about i'd be about an inch from the end of the page
g,reply_y,that's right
f,check,and i'm going straight down from that so still i'm an inch away from the page the end of the page
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,so now you've got to take it take your line to the left 'til you come into
f,query_w,towards the walled city
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,reply_y,yes
f,explain,right so i'm above the walled city now and i've curved right round it
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,explain,i'm just into the left so i'm down at the left-hand side of the page i'm just at the bottom of the walled city
g,align,the walled city is just above the cen-- halfway up the page right
f,reply_y,uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
f,check,towards the left
g,clarify,and you've you've just curved round that
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,align,and how far is it away from the left-hand side of the page
f,acknowledge,about two inches
g,acknowledge,that's fine
g,align,so if you've i-- yeah you've curved round
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,ready,right
g,align,are you in line with the bottom of the walled city
f,reply_w,bottom of it have i got to be in line with that
g,reply_n,no
g,ready,right
f,check,have i to cut
g,instruct,just take it down there so i can tell you how many more inches to go down
g,reply_y,uh-huh just there yeah
f,check,so i'm at bottom where the writing is of the walled city so i'm just just t-- in a straight line down there curve right round it 'til i'm there
g,reply_y,so uh-huh
f,check,and er am i going back to the right now
g,reply_n,no
g,clarify,you're going straight down
f,acknowledge,i'm going straight down right
g,instruct,in a slight curve you're taking it down maybe about to as far as a a third of the way up the page
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,align,you're com--
f,check,i'm taking it down there
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,in a curve
g,reply_w,just a very slight curve you know really just about vertically you're going down
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,ready,so right
f,reply_y,mmhmm
f,check,so
g,ready,now
f,explain,i'm at ghost town

f,explain,i'm at the ghost town that's it ri-- right between the carved pole and the walled city i'm right in the middle of that
g,ready,right
g,instruct,well you should curve just you you'll have to go below the
f,check,ghost town
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right i s-- aye
g,instruct,right just curve round it
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,query_yn,and have you got a stone creek
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,where's that
g,query_yn,is that about a third of the way u-- up the page

g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,and i go underneath the flat rocks
g,check,so it's just like a c--
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,it's like a curve
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,and then

g,align,so you know how you've curved round
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,align,where the buffalos are
g,align,you've you'll have to you know
f,query_w,curve round again sort of thing
