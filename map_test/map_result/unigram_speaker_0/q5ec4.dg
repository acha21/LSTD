f,query_w,which isn't there
g,clarify,but it's on on the same level as the pine tree
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,ready,right
g,instruct,and then you go up the inside of the pine tree

g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,around the top of the w-- rocket warehouse
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page
f,check,right out to the side of the page
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a
f,reply_n,no
