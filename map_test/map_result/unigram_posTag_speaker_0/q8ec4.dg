g,ready,well i
g,instruct,imagine there's like a ehm a line like horizontal
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,and then let's say f-- ph thirty degrees up the way
f,check,up the way
g,instruct,so it's at an angle
f,check,up the way
g,instruct,so it's like an angle like that
f,check,up the way
g,acknowledge,oh dear
f,check,angled up
f,query_yn,t-- do you have a lake
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,just above the start point right
g,ready,right
g,instruct,down below that
f,query_yn,how does it go from there
g,instruct,down below that
g,explain,to about halfway down the middle of the lake
f,acknowledge,halfway
f,query_w,what's that halfway what
g,align,the b-- see where the bottom of the the bottom line of the lake
f,reply_y,yeah er
g,ready,right
f,check,to the right-hand side underneath it
f,reply_y,yeah
g,reply_y,uh-huh about a
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,yeah
g,reply_w,about halfway under that
g,ready,right
f,explain,halfway well never mind
g,align,see the bottom line of the lake right
f,reply_w,oh you mean halfway from just where i would be if i went across oh no
g,ready,right
g,align,see the bottom line of the lake right
f,acknowledge,right
g,explain,halfway along that
f,acknowledge,halfway along okay
g,ready,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,and then

f,check,erm do i go along right
g,instruct,and then you go to your left
f,check,go to my left
g,instruct,for about er five centimetres
f,query_yn,is there an obstacle down at the bottom left-hand corner of your page
g,instruct,er but you shouldn't be down there

f,acknowledge,okay right
g,instruct,and then like curve round the top of the allotments
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and then go in an angle about say thirty degrees from the say
g,align,say the allotments are the horizontal right
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,go in an angle about thirty degrees up from that
g,ready,right
f,check,from the left-hand side of the or the right-hand side of the allotments above the right-hand side
g,clarify,above the right-hand side
f,check,thirty degrees
g,acknowledge,roughly
