f,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,check,to the gate
f,check,d-- undernea--
g,instruct,'til you're directly underneath the left-hand side of the gate
f,reply_y,okay right uh-huh
g,align,right
g,instruct,move straight up
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,and m-- go up past the left-hand side of the gate
f,reply_y,mmhmm
