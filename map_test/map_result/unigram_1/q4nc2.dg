f,acknowledge,right
f,align,you know how you've got the mountain
f,explain,could i just drop down straight in a straight line
f,query_yn,is there anything between the mountain and what is parallel to the field station
g,reply_n,no there's absolutely nothing there
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,so i could just drop right down then
g,acknowledge,you can drop right down there yeah
f,acknowledge,okay
f,instruct,and just go on the same level then
g,instruct,go 'til you're down to the level with this field
g,acknowledge,station okay

f,instruct,just
g,clarify,aye well not straight across but you you're you'll be going back up towards the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,so i'm below the rope the rope bridge then
g,align,so so you're at the moment you're below the rope bridge
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,and you're you're coming across in a diagonal towards the rope bridge going going from your right and up the way going to the right and up the way

f,check,so i'm heading for the rope
g,reply_y,heading for the rope bridge yeah
f,acknowledge,bridge okay
g,instruct,just go straight to the rope bridge
f,check,from there in like a uh-huh a diagonal line then from the rock fall
g,acknowledge,yeah that's right yeah
f,check,you don't want me to go across and up
g,clarify,no just straight just a diagonal line up to the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,okay then
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,and then a-- across the rope bridge to the right-hand side of the page
f,check,oh from the the top of the rope bridge or
g,reply_y,yeah across the top of the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,right okay
f,align,i've went and drawn this
g,acknowledge,yeah fine yeah
f,query_yn,can i go up and across because i've went and drawn it to the bottom of the rope bridge i can just go up and across
