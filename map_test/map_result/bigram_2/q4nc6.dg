g,instruct,it's about three or four centimetres down from that
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,eh what you're going to do is go in between the camera shop and the left-hand side of the page
g,align,right
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,see how there's about a centimetre
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,you go from the start sort of do a curve to get back onto the line and go down due south for bddllpp eh
f,check,right
f,query_yn,just missing the camera shop
g,reply_y,just missing the camera shop yeah
f,reply_y,right
f,query_yn,is there allotments
g,query_w,down to where's the allotments
g,reply_w,yes there is
g,instruct,oh you go down about double the length of that
g,check,see between the start and the allotments
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,reply_y,down
g,instruct,do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the bottom
g,acknowledge,right
f,ready,right okay
g,instruct,so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the bottom
f,check,the bottom of the page
g,acknowledge,right
f,instruct,oh wait a minute wh-- fr-- how many centimetres from the w--
f,acknowledge,oh right
g,instruct,about one centimetre from the left-hand side of the page
f,align,well so going back a bit
g,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,uh-huh uh-huh right
f,acknowledge,right okay then i know right i know what i'm doing now
g,ready,okay
f,reply_y,right okay

f,reply_y,right aye right i've got it
g,clarify,okay eh now i've got a parked van here so i'm just trying to go round it you're sort of doing a "u" shape back round past where my parked van is so just go east for about four five centimetres
g,acknowledge,right
f,reply_y,right okay
g,instruct,so you're going aiming towards the yacht club but you're going nowhere near as far as that
g,acknowledge,right
f,ready,right

g,acknowledge,all right
g,reply_y,all right that's good that's good
f,instruct,just before it i'm not actually touched the allotments yet
g,instruct,because what you're doing is you're going up the side of the allotments
f,align,right okay i'm just
g,instruct,so you're doing you're continuing that "u" shape from where you were at the start you're sort of going back up heading north towards the side of the allotments
g,acknowledge,right
f,instruct,right
g,align,see the wee black house at the left-hand side of the allotments
f,query_yn,am i just going straight up
f,reply_y,right
f,align,is that all right
g,acknowledge,yes straight up f-- from there right
f,reply_y,right okay right
g,align,right so you're at the s-- you're at the

f,explain,ehm
g,reply_w,at the bottom right-hand side
f,acknowledge,uh-huh right
g,ready,right
g,instruct,see if you forget about the line for a minute if you pick a point about sssh
g,align,see the edge of the left-hand yacht right
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,the bottom edge of it the corner
f,align,right
g,reply_y,if you aim above that for about six centimetres right
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,a point up there
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,instruct,if you can draw a diagonal line from the wee black house in the allotments up to the top up to the where that point is about six centimetres
f,query_yn,a-- have you got a flight museum

g,check,one centimetre to the right o--
g,reply_y,i think that's o-- pff
f,query_yn,but i suppose ehm i suppose if i draw a line from that wee house it might just miss the flight museum
g,instruct,right well what you're doing is you're drawing a line it's not exactly eh east right it's sort of between two and three o'clock it's very very gradual incline up for about fourteen centimetres twelve
f,acknowledge,right i n-- i know what i know what what you're doing

g,reply_y,okay
f,reply_y,right
g,explain,now this is where you've not got a thatched mud hut

g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,the bottom right-hand corner
g,align,well you're wanting see the "k" of lake
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,you're wanting to end up just about half a centimetre away from the bottom of the lake itself but underneath the letter "k"
g,acknowledge,right
f,reply_y,right okay
g,instruct,but don't draw a straight diagonal line
g,align,okay
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,because you want to from where you are just now you're above the telephone box that right
f,instruct,uh-huh i'm above the telephone box
g,instruct,you're wanting to sort of go it's a sort of curve aiming to the left and then going straight north

g,explain,so that's what you're trying to avoid if you can imagine a thatched mud hut sort of halfway between the telephone box and the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,so i'm wanting to go left
g,acknowledge,right you're sort of going left
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and then north up to just below the "k" but on the don't go into the lake just stay outside it
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,do you sort of see where i'm going
f,acknowledge,i kind of right i see that's that there right
f,acknowledge,i know you're going

f,explain,i'm not in the lake though
g,acknowledge,that's right
g,clarify,just you know the bottom of the lake it's sort of going diagonally
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,follow that the bottom of the lake right up keep about half a centimetre away from it and follow it up to the left
g,align,right
g,clarify,to the bottom corner of the lake the pointy bit
g,check,see it
g,query_yn,have you got a pointy bit
f,check,oh right this i-- this is to the left this is towards the parked van
g,ready,yes this is t-- aiming towards the parked van
f,ready,right okay right okay
f,query_w,uh-huh
g,align,so you're right under the bottom corner at the moment
f,reply_y,right
g,instruct,and just continue that line for about another centimetre and that's the finish just in the exact same
f,acknowledge,just below that wee bump
g,explain,that's be-- just below the wee bump that's it
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,exactly
f,ready,right
g,explain,and that's it
f,acknowledge,ah
g,acknowledge,that's it very good
f,check,no problem
