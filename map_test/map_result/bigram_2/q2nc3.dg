g,check,right neil erm at the bottom
g,query_yn,right-hand corner of your map do you have a missionary camp
f,reply_y,yeah
g,explain,about half an inch above it we've got an "x" marking start
f,reply_y,yes
g,query_yn,have you got that
f,reply_y,yes
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,erm now i want you to take a route about one inch directly west
g,check,if the top of the page is north and the left-hand side of the page is west
g,instruct,i want you to go about one inch west
f,align,okay
g,ready,now eh
g,instruct,we're heading about two inches southwest
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,eh which should leave you t-- at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp about an inch diagonally away from it
f,reply_y,got you
g,instruct,and then ab-- about an inch from the bottom of the page as well
f,acknowledge,sure okay
g,query_yn,now on your map on the left-hand bottom corner do you have a bunch of rather nasty looking gorillas
f,reply_n,no i don't
g,explain,well i do and i think it's something we might want to avoid
f,reply_w,right
g,ready,right so erm
g,instruct,my route tells me to go on a slightly dipping downwards line west but don't draw it yet 'til i give you the exact instructions
f,align,okay
g,instruct,this line is dipping slightly down and to the left keeping about well you'd be better to go to within about half an inch of the bottom of the page so at the bottom left-hand corner you should be about an inch from both the left-hand side and the bottom of the page a-- a half an inch from the a--
g,acknowledge,sorry i'll start that again
g,align,should be an inch from the left-hand side of the page and half an inch from the bottom side of the page at the bottom left-hand corner
g,acknowledge,okay
f,check,is this avoiding the banana tree
g,reply_n,avoiding no
g,clarify,avoiding gorillas
g,query_yn,have you got banana tree
f,reply_y,i've got a banana tree
f,explain,but it's probably in much the same place
g,acknowledge,yeah
f,align,right
g,acknowledge,right okay
f,instruct,i'll just go to where you say it avoids the banana tree anyway
g,acknowledge,so you're heading s-- s-- west but slightly southerly
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,stop about an inch from the left-hand side of the page
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,instruct,should be at a point about half an inch off the bottom of the page now
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,align,right
g,explain,now i think we should eh read the banana tree as where the gorillas live so
f,reply_y,right
g,reply_y,erm avoiding the banana tree i suppose
f,reply_y,yeah
g,ready,erm go about
g,ready,well hang on
g,query_yn,have you got a rope bridge on your map
f,reply_y,yeah i do
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,clarify,draw a line straight up horizontally level with the rope bridge
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,eh go across the rope bridge and just stop at the end of it
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,go directly down half an inch
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,go to
f,reply_y,i do yeah
g,query_yn,have you got a waterfall on your map at the right-hand side

g,explain,like a sort of steam you know vapour
f,reply_y,yeah uh-huh
g,instruct,right well you should be at a point horizontally level and to the left of that cloud
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,query_yn,right head s-- s-- have you got anything between the waterfall and the lost steps
f,query_yn,no sod all
g,reply_w,right
g,instruct,go up about four inches directly up so you're at the top right-hand side of the lost steps
f,check,four inches directly up the side top right-hand side
g,acknowledge,yeah
f,acknowledge,that's not directly up on mine
g,ready,alright
g,query_w,where are the lost steps in relation to the waterfall
f,reply_w,they are about about seven inches away
g,uncodable,seven inches
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,clarify,well mine aren't slightly nearer mine are only about three inches away
f,acknowledge,ah
g,instruct,so if you go up four inches

f,ready,they they are exactly er a horizontal line away from me
g,acknowledge,horizontally level
f,reply_y,uh-huh
f,align,four inches away
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,query_yn,draw an arc between where you are now to the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars
f,align,an arc as in up arc or down arc
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,yeah up up to the left round the lost steps and curving down between the fallen pillars and where you are just now
f,acknowledge,ah
g,reply_w,eh at the bottom right-hand side of the fallen pillars

g,instruct,eh right go about s-- eh see from where you are just now
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,explain,if that was eh mm how can i put this if that was the bottom of a circle right no sorry the right-hand side of a circle right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,explain,at the middle point at the mid point of the right-hand side of the circle
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,i want you to draw a circle erm
g,check,hang on don't draw it yet
f,uncodable,no i'm not drawing yet
g,explain,i i'm still i'm still thinking what i'm going to say here
g,align,right so you're at the right-hand side of the circle

f,reply_y,down
g,check,left
f,reply_y,acr-- right
g,instruct,now go straight down about three inches
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and curve round to the right just just a small curve the the length of the curve should be about two centimetres
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_y,and
f,query_yn,is it an u-- an u-- a "u"-turn or a
g,query_yn,well have you got gazelles on yours

f,reply_w,uh about six inches
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,well keep going
g,explain,i think they're the same as mine
f,acknowledge,so
f,reply_n,no
g,instruct,just keep going in a straight line don't go into the curve yet until you get to the gazelles
f,instruct,and then curve round the gazelles
g,instruct,curve round the gazelles 'til you're facing right now
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,right go about two inches
g,instruct,and that's us finished
f,reply_y,two inches to the right
g,acknowledge,yeah
