g,uncodable,erm
g,align,are you at the cross at the start
f,acknowledge,okay yeah
g,ready,right so
g,instruct,go er about two inches to your ehm to your left at a sort of a-- angle
g,reply_w,about
f,explain,two inches to the my
g,instruct,your left a sort of angle about forty-five degrees
f,uncodable,erm
g,uncodable,to er
f,reply_w,what's two inches sort about
g,instruct,well it's two inches
g,reply_w,i don't know actually er
g,instruct,er well ten centimetres then maybe say
f,instruct,ten er to forty-five degrees slope
g,instruct,to the horizontal
f,query_yn,have you got allotments to my right is it
g,reply_n,no
g,explain,it's different it's a different map ehm
f,reply_y,yeah
f,explain,erm t-- it can't be to my left anyway 'cause that's off the page from the start
g,ready,well
g,explain,it's to my right so it must be to your left
f,reply_n,no
f,explain,it's the map's turned round so it must be to my right as well if it's to your right it's to my right
g,acknowledge,oh right sorry
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,go to your right then ten centimetres to your right
f,query_yn,erm right along or to an angle did you say
g,explain,well i
g,instruct,imagine there's like a ehm a line like horizontal
g,acknowledge,right
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,and then let's say f-- ph thirty degrees up the way
f,check,up the way
g,check,so it's at an angle
f,check,up the way
g,check,so it's like an angle like that
f,check,up the way
g,acknowledge,oh dear
f,check,angled up
f,query_yn,t-- do you have a lake
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,just above the start point right
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,down below that
f,query_w,how does it go from there
g,acknowledge,down below that
g,instruct,to about halfway down the middle of the lake
f,check,halfway
f,query_w,what's that halfway what
g,align,the b-- see where the bottom of the the bottom line of the lake
f,uncodable,yeah er
g,acknowledge,right
f,clarify,to the right-hand side underneath it
f,reply_y,yeah
g,reply_y,uh-huh about a
g,acknowledge,right
f,reply_y,yeah
g,check,about halfway under that
g,acknowledge,right
f,instruct,halfway well never mind
g,align,see the bottom line of the lake right
f,check,oh you mean halfway from just where i would be if i went across oh no
g,acknowledge,right
g,align,see the bottom line of the lake right
f,acknowledge,right
g,explain,halfway along that
f,align,halfway along okay
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,and then
g,ready,then
g,check,straight down
f,check,straight down
g,reply_w,about
g,instruct,er maybe five centimetres
f,explain,right i've got some allotments here
f,query_yn,so does it go to your right again does it go right
g,reply_w,it sort of curves round
f,acknowledge,curves round okay right
g,ready,and then then
f,check,along to your right
g,instruct,it's like an "s" shape right but n-- not like a steep "s" shape like a sort of er sort of stretched out "s" shape
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,a wee bit ehm 'til you're about er halfway down the page when you get to the bottom curve that comes back out the way
f,query_yn,erm do i go along right
g,instruct,and then you go to your left
f,check,go to my left
g,reply_w,for about er five centimetres
f,query_yn,is there an obstacle down at the bottom left-hand corner of your page
g,instruct,er but you shouldn't be down there
g,instruct,this is you're over on the right-hand side at the right-hand si-- half of your page
f,ready,erm well
g,reply_n,no
f,query_yn,a we-- is it called the west lake the start
g,align,it's east lake at the start of mine

g,reply_w,well i don't have i don't know about
g,align,are you over at the right-hand side how about halfway down the page at the moment
f,acknowledge,okay
f,reply_w,eas-- hold on start up at the east lake
f,query_w,where's the start
g,check,what do you want me to start again
f,reply_y,yeah
f,explain,'cause i've got a start underneath the west lake so i'm at
g,ready,oh do you know what i've been doing oh god
f,query_w,what
g,explain,i've i've started from the finish that's why i wasnae even looking at that i just saw the cross er right
g,acknowledge,oops right
g,explain,so we should be at the bottom left-hand corner of the map here right
f,acknowledge,right
g,explain,i've went through the the other way round that's really stupid right eh
f,acknowledge,okay right
g,instruct,so the start's about
f,align,you're at the west lake

g,ready,right so er
g,instruct,just sort of go to your left
f,check,go to my left
g,check,about a centimetre
f,acknowledge,oh w-- a centimetre right hold on right now a centimetre okay right
g,instruct,and then go straight down
f,check,straight down
f,query_w,to where how long
g,instruct,to about two centimetres from the bottom of the page
f,acknowledge,two centimetres from the bottom of the page okay
g,instruct,then go to your right about eh five centimetres
f,instruct,fffffff
f,reply_w,five centimetres right
g,instruct,and then go
f,query_yn,er ch do you have any an allotments
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,allotments yeah

f,reply_y,yeah right yeah
g,uncodable,well s--
g,instruct,just go straight up the way so you're a bit left of the allotments
f,check,just left
g,instruct,up about half a centimetre ef-- left
f,acknowledge,okay right
g,instruct,and then like curve round the top of the allotments
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and then go in an angle about say thirty degrees from the say
g,instruct,say the allotments are the horizontal right
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,go in an angle about thirty degrees up from that
g,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,from the left-hand side of the or the right-hand side of the allotments above the right-hand side
g,check,above the right-hand side
f,instruct,thirty degrees
g,check,roughly
f,ready,thir--
g,instruct,and then say about ehm eh over to about two thirds of the way over the side of the page to the right
g,reply_n,no
f,query_yn,erm do you have a flight museum anywhere

f,check,and do i go underneath it or above it
g,check,over the top of it
f,check,over the top
f,acknowledge,okay
f,explain,round to my
g,instruct,round and then and then li-- when you're round the side of that a l-- a straight line to about er maybe ten centimetres out from the side the left-hand side of the page
f,reply_w,six centimetres right
f,query_yn,do you have an alpine garden just above you

f,instruct,erm about one centimetre from the side of the alpine garden that's above it and along one
g,instruct,go along a wee bit
g,align,until see the "d" of the alpine garden on the in between the "d" of the see where it says alpine garden
f,reply_y,yeah
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,just look at that the d-- in between the "d" and "e" just put a straight line straight above that
