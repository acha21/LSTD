f,acknowledge,a pretend semicircle to the
f,query_w,inside or the outs--
g,reply_w,well like you know a pretend loop
f,acknowledge,aye
f,query_yn,to the inside or the outside of the map
g,reply_w,right start right so you're just below the cliffs
f,explain,i'm just below the cliffs
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,so you go out towards outside of the map
f,acknowledge,towards the outside of the map right
g,reply_y,yeah and then round the bottom of the forge which isn't there
f,query_w,which isn't there
g,explain,but it's on on the same level as the pine tree
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,ready,right
g,instruct,and then you go up the inside of the pine tree
f,acknowledge,the inside
g,acknowledge,right not th-- no that the left of the pine tree so the that's outside of the map
f,acknowledge,t-- t-- to the left of the pine tr--
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,up past the pine tree
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,explain,the pine tree is always on my right
g,acknowledge,yeah
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,and then so you get to the top of the pine tree
f,explain,top of the pine tree

f,instruct,right stop at the "p"
f,align,right
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then sort of loop round a wee bit more don't don't draw your line in the same angle sort of make it a bit flatter and then draw another wee loop
f,query_w,a bit flatter th-- what on the same
f,query_yn,does this have have i to cross a stream
g,query_w,what
f,reply_w,have i to cross a stream
g,reply_n,no

f,query_w,it runs
g,clarify,you're drawing a nose right say this is the face you're drawing and then you've got to sort of do a sort of round bit for the nose
g,reply_y,beneath the pine forest
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,is that beneath so is the nose to come beneath the pine forest
f,ready,okay right
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,yes
g,query_yn,have you got a bakery underneath right a bit lower down
g,align,right so see when the nose comes out it comes back in to the face

g,align,is that okay
f,reply_y,okay
g,instruct,and then go and do another big nose round the bakery
f,check,round the bakery

f,acknowledge,okay right
g,ready,right
g,ready,and eh then it's sort of
g,query_yn,have you got wheatfields
f,reply_y,yes
f,explain,but they're up the top

g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,well sort of sticking to the coast
g,align,you know wher-- go-- whe-- whe-- where the coast goes up and down vertical
f,reply_y,yes
g,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,instruct,around the top of the w-- rocket warehouse
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page
f,check,right out to the side of the page
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a
f,reply_n,no
g,align,are you about th-- in line with the rocket bit or have you done that
f,reply_w,i'm past the rocket
g,align,no but like s-- see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written
f,reply_y,oh aye near enough
g,ready,right
g,instruct,so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page
f,reply_w,down the side of the page
g,instruct,for about two centimetres
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then curve it back in towards the old
f,query_yn,past the cave
