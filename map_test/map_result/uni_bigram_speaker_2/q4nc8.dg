g,ready,okay
g,instruct,paul we're starting top left
f,acknowledge,right you've got a diamond mine
g,explain,i've got a diamond mine
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,okay drop s-- straight down to the "d" of
f,acknowledge,right that's okay right okay right
g,align,okay
g,explain,this is very difficult
f,ready,okay
g,instruct,drop drop straight straight down the side of the diamond mine to to the "d" of diamond mine
f,align,okay
f,check,just below it
g,check,just below it yeah
f,check,pen's
g,instruct,and then you're going to go right drawing a line underneath diamond mine
f,explain,hold on hold on my pen's run out oh no it's working
g,instruct,okay you're going to draw you're going to underline diamond mine
f,acknowledge,underline it right
f,check,so right underline it along to the "e"
f,acknowledge,of diamond
g,check,und-- underline it un-- underline it along to the "e"
f,ready,pen's not working very well
g,ready,okay
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,of highest viewpoint
g,instruct,right and continue the line until you're until you're directly below the "h" of highest viewpoint
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,so i've just got an an east line a right-hand a line going thr-- to the right all the way from
g,reply_y,a line going
f,acknowledge,okey-doke

g,acknowledge,how it's virtually the same position
f,check,virtually the same position the other side left-hand side of the page just up slightly
g,explain,it's up slightly
f,acknowledge,aye just slightly aye
g,acknowledge,okay right
f,check,a centimetre up
g,instruct,right what what you've got to do here is you've got to drop down towards the safari truck
f,acknowledge,y-- okay
f,query_w,which side of the safari truck
g,clarify,ehm drop down 'til until you're
g,instruct,right wait a minute let me see
f,query_w,towards the right-hand side of it or towards
g,reply_w,the the safari truck i think it it looks like a steering wheel on the right-hand side
f,acknowledge,the right-hand side
g,align,can you see it
f,query_yn,is it sort of handlebar type thing
g,align,right see the see the right-hand see the right-hand wheel
f,reply_y,yes
g,acknowledge,drop down towards that
f,acknowledge,right okay but
g,instruct,and and stop just just above the safari truck
f,check,am i draw--
f,align,so i'm at the right-hand side of the highest viewpoint at the moment
g,reply_y,yeah uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay and
g,instruct,and you're dropping straight down

g,instruct,right you now need to turn left
f,explain,okay i'm directly in line with the field station at this
g,acknowledge,right that's fine okay
g,instruct,you you want to turn left and head towards the field station but don't right wait a minute and and stop when you are at er when you're directly below the "t" of highest viewpoint the the f-- "t" of highest
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,align,stop direct--
f,check,so just doing a straight line

g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,instruct,and then go across and round the top of the banana go left to across and round
g,check,round the top
f,check,so quite a quite a long line
g,acknowledge,yeah
f,acknowledge,round the top
g,instruct,around the top of the banana tree
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,check,and down the side of it
g,instruct,and we're going down the side
f,check,right so i'm going south down the side
g,instruct,you're going south
