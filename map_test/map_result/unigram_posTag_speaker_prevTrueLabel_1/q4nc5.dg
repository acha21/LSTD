g,ready,right
g,instruct,it starts at start
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,and it stops just horizontally from ravine but it stops down from start
g,align,do you know what i mean
f,check,stops horizontally from ravine
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,clarify,it's just on line with ravine but it's like just a curvy line and you stop just where you started
g,query_yn,do you know what i mean it doesn't make sense does it
f,reply_n,no

f,check,so we're stopping d-- below start
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,and to the to the left of ravine
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,just tell you what draw a straight line
g,align,okay
f,query_w,to where
g,ready,right

f,query_w,and then whereabouts after that
g,clarify,you go down until just underneath
g,align,right see "p" of pine grove
f,reply_y,yeah
g,instruct,just go down
f,check,so i-- i don't i'm going d-- d-- down the left-hand side of pine grove
g,reply_y,uh-huh that's right

f,check,so i've got to go down to the top of the concealed hideout and then across to the right
g,uncodable,eh
f,acknowledge,that be right
g,align,see it's a curvy line
g,explain,i don't know how i could describe this
f,check,but if i if i just go in straight lines to to miss the things
g,reply_y,okay then uh-huh yeah sure
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,clarify,if i go down to the top of the the concealed hideout and then straight along the top of the concealed hideout
f,reply_y,is that right
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay
g,align,okay
f,check,so i
g,instruct,and you're missing out
f,check,so i miss the bottom of the avalanche i'm going underneath the avalanche
g,acknowledge,right that's good

g,acknowledge,okay
f,ready,so
g,ready,and it's like ehm
f,query_yn,is it in the curvy bay bit
g,query_w,in the what
f,align,see the curvy bay see where it says crane bay and there's a big curve
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,query_yn,is it in that bit
g,reply_w,no it's up it's
g,ready,right
g,instruct,it's just on the same level as the concealed hideout
