f,check,so over the river then
g,reply_n,ehm no hang on
f,explain,i'm at i'm at the left of the of the stream going down
g,acknowledge,oh right right sorry
g,instruct,ehm you're supposed to be at the right
g,uncodable,ehm
f,check,oh i'm supposed to right i'm supposed to go over the river then
g,acknowledge,no
g,ready,right
g,instruct,go back to where the groove in crane bay is
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,query_yn,ehm now did you go along to the right yeah
f,acknowledge,i went to the right
f,check,and down past the side of the local residents you know between that and the river
g,acknowledge,oh right right oh right sorry ehm

g,reply_y,uh-huh yeah
f,acknowledge,right okay i'm there now
f,acknowledge,right
g,ready,right and ehm
