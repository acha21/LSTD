f,acknowledge,right
f,query_yn,eh can you be sure that does it say can you be sure they are pelicans
g,instruct,it says pelicans underneath them
g,check,amongst other indications like the big saggy bit under the beak and stuff

g,instruct,if you haven't got the same stuff and i'd go for a big
f,reply_y,yeah i think we're all right okay uh-huh
g,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,the start is above the summit of the extinct volcano in the bottom right-hand corner of the page
g,query_yn,have you got one of them
f,reply_y,uh i have got that
f,explain,it says start
g,acknowledge,right
g,explain,it says start
f,acknowledge,uh-huh hmm
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,well you take the dotted line down to the left until it's below the volcano and you go along to the left under the tribal settlement
f,explain,i haven't got a tribal settlement
g,acknowledge,aha
f,acknowledge,right
g,uncodable,so i 'pose you just
f,check,so i just i go sh-- sh-- straight down
g,clarify,you go sort of off the top of the volcano sort of thing
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,above the volcano and then down past it on the left
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,and then sort of down along the page straight along the bottom of the page
f,clarify,straight along about the same level as the volcano
g,reply_w,a bit below it a bit below it
g,explain,and then there's a there's a on mine there's a tribal settlement
g,acknowledge,right
f,explain,right i haven't got one of them
g,explain,in the bottom left-hand corner of the page
g,clarify,so you go round that
f,acknowledge,i know
f,explain,but i don't have one of them
g,reply_y,aye
g,explain,well imagine it's there
f,acknowledge,mm-mm right
f,query_yn,have you got a rope bridge
g,reply_y,uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,explain,i've got a
g,instruct,after you've gone round the tribal settlement you go up and then you cross the rope bridge from left to right
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,once you get to the other side of the rope bridge you go down about an inch and then you go straight along again towards the right and up
f,instruct,wait a minute down about an inch
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,round the machete
g,reply_y,well i suppose so aye
g,explain,i haven't got a machete
f,check,oh you haven't got one
g,explain,but i suppose it would probably be a good idea to go round it
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,anyway you go down about an inch and along
f,acknowledge,mmhmm to the right right
g,instruct,to the right until you come just to the left of the collapsed shelter and go straight up past it to the left of it
g,query_yn,if you've got a collapsed shelter
f,acknowledge,uh-huh i've got one
g,acknowledge,right
f,check,right so i'm going up that
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,ready,right so then

f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,right
f,check,above the crevasse
f,query_yn,have you got a crevasse
g,reply_y,uh-huh that's must be why you go all the way up there

g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,instruct,that's you know what i mean it goes up to the middle of the page to above th-- the level of the saxon barn and then it goes across towards the left over the crevasse presumably and down between that and the saxon barn and then along under the saxon barn do you see what i mean
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,and once you get to the other side of the saxon barn underneath it you go down about an inch to avoid the pelicans
f,acknowledge,oh right
g,acknowledge,right
f,explain,which i haven't got right
g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,go down about an inch and along about an inch and then back up again to the left of the pelicans if you see what i mean

f,align,see where it's written white mountain
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,query_w,do i go between that and the actual drawing of the mountain or do i go round the top of the mountain
g,explain,your mountain must be different from mine
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,just go up the side of the page straight past the whole lot
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
g,check,so have you gone past the top of the mountain to the left of it

g,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,until you come sort of to sort of underneath it underneath the words slate mountain
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,ready,and then ehm
g,check,sort of drop down again down the middle of the page a couple of inches
f,explain,i can't do that
g,query_w,why not
f,explain,'cause i've got some submerged rocks
g,acknowledge,aye well
f,query_yn,have you got them
g,check,is that underneath the slate mountain
