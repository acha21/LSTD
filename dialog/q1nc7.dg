g,align,see where you are now you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,can you make a sort of a wide circle sort of a half circle towards the ehm bottom of that point that curve of west lake
g,align,right see where the "e" is in west lake
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,align,in lake
g,instruct,eh go r-- it's right underneath there
g,align,you know i'm talking about that point
f,reply_y,yes
f,query_w,a w--
g,instruct,where it starts to curve like it's to there eh you need a kind of wide ci-- a h-- half circle
g,instruct,eh but you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the page
f,query_w,what am i avoiding
f,query_w,see this eh what is it the thing you told me to mark

g,align,right
f,reply_y,yes
g,instruct,at west lake right we're at that corner go round right round the circle
f,check,to the right
g,ready,then
g,reply_y,uh-huh to the right
g,instruct,then up keep going up
f,query_w,how far
g,reply_w,'til you stop

f,acknowledge,right i've done that
g,ready,right
g,align,see beside ehm see where you've stopped then right do you know where that sharp bit is i'm talking about
f,explain,just it curves round and then it goes up vertically and then you've i--
g,instruct,follow that bit up vertically right 'til it stops going vertically that's what i mean right
f,acknowledge,uh-huh i've done that right
g,ready,right
g,align,see where you've stopped
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,align,and how you can see a kind of a straight line it's almost a straight line
f,uncodable,ehm
g,align,to your left in the west lake you know it goes folli-- it's sort of goes up vertically and it goes straight to your left well it goes up a bit
f,check,it goes up vertically then it goes to the left
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,reply_y,mmhmm

f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,see where that that vertical see that ehm
g,align,that line on the west lake goes sh-- sharply up
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,dra-- draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,check,right down to the monument eh

f,ready,and eh
f,query_yn,have you got a golf course
g,reply_n,no
g,check,i take it you're going round the golf course

g,acknowledge,ah so it is
g,ready,right
g,align,so where see the monument is
f,explain,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course
g,instruct,you're going underneath the monument and up
g,align,okay
g,instruct,you're curving round the monument
f,check,i'm com-- i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving r--
f,check,round the bottom of it
g,clarify,and go round underneath it
g,reply_y,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh
f,check,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below
g,reply_n,no
f,check,between the west lake and the monument
g,check,the west lake and the monument
g,reply_w,i've got a p-- trig point
f,query_w,where's that so i have i have to avoid it
g,reply_w,that's that's it's abou-- it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up
f,query_w,but where is it anyway
g,reply_w,where the vertical bit is
f,query_w,where is it
g,align,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,reply_w,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake
f,acknowledge,okay
f,ready,right
f,check,so if i draw down
g,clarify,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake
f,acknowledge,i will have right uh-huh
g,acknowledge,you will right
g,clarify,and then you go straight it's a total straight line
f,acknowledge,a straight line
g,clarify,going sloping downwards towards the monument
f,acknowledge,right
f,check,i've and then curve round the monument
g,reply_y,round the monument
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,i've done that
g,clarify,just right round that
g,ready,eh sort of right
g,align,are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head
g,ready,right
f,reply_y,yes that's where i am
g,instruct,stop about there okay curved above it
g,align,ehm you know the east lake is
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,instruct,just go vertically up there
f,acknowledge,right
f,query_w,how far
g,ready,fact
g,explain,i'll tell you what would be even better
g,align,see the the guy's head on the monument the guy's hand sorry
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,where it's pointing right
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,ready,so
g,instruct,go straight draw the line to you know where your fa--
g,align,see that curve that you're drawing round the monument
f,reply_y,mmhmm
g,instruct,stop above his hand
g,align,right
f,explain,ah i went a bit further 'cause i thought you said
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,ready,right
g,instruct,and just c-- and go from there go straight up towards the east lake so you should be directly under the the "e" in lake

f,check,directly
f,check,underneath the "e"
g,clarify,underneath the "e"
g,reply_y,underneath the "e"
g,clarify,make a dot right beside the lake
g,instruct,and from the monument the guy's hand on the monument draw a line from that
g,align,okay

g,align,see the "e" in the east
f,reply_y,yes
g,align,the letter the word east
g,clarify,underneath that draw a line about an inch away from that okay keep following the coast line
f,acknowledge,right
g,clarify,but don't don't go up don't go up vertically
f,acknowledge,don't go up
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,clarify,you kn-- h-- just go straight along that except carry the line on
f,query_w,how far
g,reply_w,for about another centimetre
g,instruct,and just draw a cross
f,check,a centimetre from the "e"
g,reply_y,mmhmm
f,check,is that all
f,acknowledge,right
g,reply_y,mmhmm
g,align,y-- but see where the east lake is see that that kind of line you followed
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,s-- of the lake
f,reply_y,uh-huh
g,align,d-- you haven't gone up have you
g,explain,'cause the line goes straight up you know how it goes vertically up
f,query_w,what with the
f,reply_n,no i haven't done that
g,ready,well
g,acknowledge,that's okay
g,instruct,that'll be it finished
