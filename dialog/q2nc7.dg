f,query_w,where in which direction
g,reply_w,to the right
f,check,to the right
g,reply_y,uh-huh
f,check,this is once i'm beyond the apex of the curve
g,reply_y,yeah
f,query_w,how far should i be beyond the apex of the curve
g,reply_w,well should be about an inch an inch and a half down
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,instruct,you've got
f,check,and then horizontally
g,clarify,down to the right about three inches
f,acknowledge,right
g,instruct,then you go down two inches straight down
g,reply_w,but i
g,reply_w,i've got
f,query_w,how far am i from the right-hand side of the page just now when i'm when i'm heading horizontally right
