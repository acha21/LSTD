f,acknowledge,how far do you west do you want me to go
g,acknowledge,just beyond crest falls
f,acknowledge,right okay yes
g,acknowledge,due south to level at the bottom of crest falls
g,acknowledge,that sounded like a long line ken

f,acknowledge,right i'm right under it
g,acknowledge,right exactly
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,come across a tad 'til you are a-- r-- roughly a centimetre from the white mountain if you take a line up but not un-- a-- y-- y-- you know as-- it-- so that your line is the same direction that you took the line under the pyramid
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,just take it a wee bit further across so that you'll clear the remote village
f,acknowledge,right all right no problem
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,i'm so i'm just above the white mountain
g,acknowledge,you're actually above it
