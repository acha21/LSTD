g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,ah this is the same one i got with lynn we spent ages on it
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,oh good stuff
g,acknowledge,you haven't had this one have you
f,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,the burnt forest the remote village
f,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,all right okay
g,acknowledge,okay then right
g,acknowledge,you're at start
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,at the top right-hand
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,right okay fine yeah
f,acknowledge,top top left
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,oh i'm sure
g,acknowledge,oh no i just couldn't do this last time
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,top left right where
f,acknowledge,ah-- a--
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,i'm sort of up to the to the left of the burnt forest
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,right well
g,acknowledge,what it is is it's a it's a kind of curved line right but don't draw this i'm just telling you what it is but we just drew a straight line last time it's a curved line from start in this this
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,it starts at start
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,and it stops just horizontally from ravine but it stops down from start
g,acknowledge,do you know what i mean
f,acknowledge,stops horizontally from ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,it's just on line with ravine but it's like just a curvy line and you stop just where you started
g,acknowledge,do you know what i mean it doesn't make sense does it
f,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,in fact you just wa--
f,acknowledge,so we're stopping d-- below start
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,and to the to the left of ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,just tell you what draw a straight line
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,to where
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,from start down to right vertical
f,acknowledge,just straight down
g,acknowledge,straight down
g,acknowledge,you haven't g-- you aren't going through anything are you
f,acknowledge,to a-- th-- there's i've got a carpenter's cottage
g,acknowledge,where
f,acknowledge,to the left of the ravine
f,acknowledge,so i obviously need to miss that on the left-hand side
g,acknowledge,uh-huh miss that
f,acknowledge,and just come down to level with the ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,okay right
g,acknowledge,and it's a vertical line yeah
f,acknowledge,yeah
f,acknowledge,mmhmm okay
g,acknowledge,yeah right that's good
g,acknowledge,and then you you draw horizontally just and stop where the "t" is of forest
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,forest
f,acknowledge,oh right okay
g,acknowledge,burnt forest
f,acknowledge,so okay fine
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,and then
f,acknowledge,so i'm level with ravine and coming across to to the "t" of forest
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right and then
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,you go up
f,acknowledge,so i'm going round the top of the ravine
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right that's good
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,and then horizontal
g,acknowledge,have you got a remote village
f,acknowledge,no i don't
g,acknowledge,oh right
f,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,right that's right i forgot
g,acknowledge,right you know where the seagulls are
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,well just go up and round the ravine in a
g,acknowledge,do you know what i mean
f,acknowledge,so i'm go-- going a-- across the top of the ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,and down again
g,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,just keep on eh zzz
f,acknowledge,ah-- just straight across in a a horizontal across the top of the ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right
g,acknowledge,and stop at the top
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,and you've not vent-- v-- have you went very far up from the ravine
f,acknowledge,no i've just gone over the top of the seagulls
g,acknowledge,right that's good that's good
g,acknowledge,right and then
g,acknowledge,uu-uu
g,acknowledge,see you go under this remote village but you've not got it ehm
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,so what about the pine g-- pine grove have you got that
f,acknowledge,how
g,acknowledge,yeah i've got that
f,acknowledge,if i go towards that
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,and is it above the pine grove the remote village
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,whe-- wh--
g,acknowledge,it's just above the ravine
f,acknowledge,it's just above the ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,so a-- at the moment i'm going underneath it
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right
f,acknowledge,if i've just come across the top of the ravine
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,so i want to head towards the trees
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,the pine grove
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,a--
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,and then whereabouts after that
g,acknowledge,you go down until just underneath
g,acknowledge,right see "p" of pine grove
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,just go down
f,acknowledge,so i-- i don't i'm going d-- d-- down the left-hand side of pine grove
g,acknowledge,uh-huh that's right
f,acknowledge,and to to the "p"
g,acknowledge,uh-huh okay
f,acknowledge,so i want to be right at the "p"
g,acknowledge,well sort of
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,about a centimetre away from it okay
f,acknowledge,right fine okay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh right ehm
g,acknowledge,where you've got something else haven't you underneath the pine grove
f,acknowledge,i've got an avalanche
g,acknowledge,uh-huh right well--
f,acknowledge,which is a bit over to the right-hand side
g,acknowledge,and down
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,okay well and you've got the concealed hideout
f,acknowledge,yeah i've got that
g,acknowledge,well draw a line so you miss out the avalanche
f,acknowledge,sti-- am i going round to the right o-- s-- hand side of the avalan-- the concealed hid-- hideout
g,acknowledge,ehm right
f,acknowledge,where do i want to go in relation to the concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,you miss out
g,acknowledge,right see in the line
g,acknowledge,v-- you miss out you put the concealed hideout to your right and
g,acknowledge,no wait a minute wait a minute
g,acknowledge,you put the avalanche to the right of your line and the concealed hideout to the left of your line
f,acknowledge,so i've got to go down to the top of the concealed hideout and then across to the right
g,acknowledge,eh
f,acknowledge,that be right
g,acknowledge,see it's a curvy line
g,acknowledge,i don't know how i could describe this
f,acknowledge,but if i if i just go in straight lines to to miss the things
g,acknowledge,okay then uh-huh yeah sure
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,if i go down to the top of the the concealed hideout and then straight along the top of the concealed hideout
f,acknowledge,is that right
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,so i
g,acknowledge,and you're missing out
f,acknowledge,so i miss the bottom of the avalanche i'm going underneath the avalanche
g,acknowledge,right that's good
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,so it's not involved in your line like it's to the right of
f,acknowledge,it's to the right of it's to the right of the line yeah
g,acknowledge,your line yeah that's good and right
g,acknowledge,so draw round the concealed hideout 'cause it's actually in your line you know what i mean it's to the r-- to the left of your line
g,acknowledge,do you know what i mean
f,acknowledge,so i've got to go i've got to go down past the concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,you just draw round it
f,acknowledge,yeah right okay
g,acknowledge,just draw a wee kind of circle round it
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,and then heading
g,acknowledge,do you know where the boat house is
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,have you got one just
f,acknowledge,it's directly below me now it's to the right of the concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,eh
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,i'm j-- i'm just i'll tell you where i am i'm at the "t" of concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,good good right well i've got two boathouses right
g,acknowledge,i think you you've only got one 'cause lynn only had one
f,acknowledge,i've got one and it's on the right-hand side of the page
f,acknowledge,ehm which
g,acknowledge,is it just below concealed hideout
f,acknowledge,it's it's directly it's it's directly below the "t" of concealed hideout
g,acknowledge,quite a bit down
f,acknowledge,ehm not that far it's about wh-- i don't know
g,acknowledge,how many
f,acknowledge,four or five centimetres five centimetres maybe
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,well i've got another one
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,i've got one that's ehm
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,it's to the left of the concealed hideout about a centimetre down
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,so
g,acknowledge,and it's like ehm
f,acknowledge,is it in the curvy bay bit
g,acknowledge,in the what
f,acknowledge,see the curvy bay see where it says crane bay and there's a big curve
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,is it in that bit
g,acknowledge,no it's up it's
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,it's just on the same level as the concealed hideout
f,acknowledge,it's on the same level
f,acknowledge,below
g,acknowledge,same well kind of it's just like a centimetre down
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,right okay i think
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,so what you do is right you know how you've got crane bay
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,and you know how you've got the first right you start off from your right okay and you've
g,acknowledge,know how you've got that first kind of bump
g,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,the of the bay
g,acknowledge,i tell you what i
g,acknowledge,mmhmm
f,acknowledge,the corner of the bay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,see if i go down to the bay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,and just go along the shore will i miss everything
g,acknowledge,right i'll tell you what right
g,acknowledge,you're und-- you're under "t" just now
f,acknowledge,yeah i'm just at "t" uh-huh
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,well right see the "b" of bay
f,acknowledge,the "b" of bay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,go up right just go underne-- oh right
f,acknowledge,head for "b" of bee-- bay
f,acknowledge,oh
g,acknowledge,no no no no no no no no
g,acknowledge,right ehm
g,acknowledge,go underneath the word concealed bay just draw a horizontal line underneath it
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,concealed
g,acknowledge,bay
g,acknowledge,oh concealed hideout
f,acknowledge,conc-- hideout uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,do a straight line
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,and then draw ehm go over another two centimetres
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,and stop
f,acknowledge,one two right okay
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,and then go right down and you should be like vertical with b-- the "b" of bay
f,acknowledge,right that's yeah that's where i
g,acknowledge,oh that's great that's great
f,acknowledge,am okay right so i'm coming straight straight down to the "b" of
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,bay right okay
g,acknowledge,but not go through not go uu-uu
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,i've just got it coming down to the edge of the lake
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,lake
f,acknowledge,or the the sea or whatever it is at the bottom
g,acknowledge,oh right okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,you know that wee curve
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,just draw round it
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,you're a-- maybe about a half a centimetre above it
f,acknowledge,i'm goi-- going over to the left now
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,that's right
g,acknowledge,have you got a coconut palm
f,acknowledge,no
g,acknowledge,ah sugar
g,acknowledge,you've got the pebbled bay ehm
f,acknowledge,pebbled shore
g,acknowledge,pebbled shore pe--
g,acknowledge,i've got bay on the brain
g,acknowledge,right ehm
g,acknowledge,what you could do is ehm
f,acknowledge,i want to go to the tilled land that looks quite cool
g,acknowledge,the what
f,acknowledge,the tilled land
g,acknowledge,oh right
f,acknowledge,have you got tilled land it's away up the top somewhere
g,acknowledge,it's just totally out of nowhere
f,acknowledge,woo
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,what you could do is you could just follow
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,go a-- you know your bump know how i've told you to draw that curve
f,acknowledge,y-- yeah uh-huh
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,there's a bump just a-- a-- above "c"
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,just draw round it
f,acknowledge,draw round that okay
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,until you come parallel to the pebbled shore
f,acknowledge,'til i come down to the pebbled shore
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,and then draw a horizontal line
f,acknowledge,so i might go under pebbled shore
g,acknowledge,no no
f,acknowledge,above it
g,acknowledge,above it
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,draw a horizontal line above it
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,you've also got something underneath the pebbled shore haven't you
f,acknowledge,yeah i've got i've got washed stones
g,acknowledge,wow
f,acknowledge,goodness knows what they are

g,acknowledge,lucky you
f,acknowledge,mm
f,acknowledge,well
g,acknowledge,oh no
g,acknowledge,right ehm
f,acknowledge,ouch
g,acknowledge,you g-- i would suppose that you go round them
g,acknowledge,right where the finish is is just
g,acknowledge,know the flagship
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,well you know the windows of the flagship
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,ehm it's like
f,acknowledge,level with them
g,acknowledge,level with them
g,acknowledge,good word thank you
f,acknowledge,on the shore below b-- is it below a-- any of the letters in pebbled shore
f,acknowledge,like the "p" maybe
g,acknowledge,ehm it's underneath the uh-huh the "p" or the it's underneath the the "e" and the "b"
f,acknowledge,aye i'm going to just
g,acknowledge,so that's where the finish is
g,acknowledge,right
f,acknowledge,going to d-- i'm just going to dodge this i'm going to do a wee "s" round here
g,acknowledge,okay
f,acknowledge,and go down to the
g,acknowledge,you go but don't right
g,acknowledge,see your washed stones
f,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,ha ha
f,acknowledge,yeah er
g,acknowledge,put them to the ehm oh to the thingy the right of the line
f,acknowledge,to the right of the line
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,right i'll do it
f,acknowledge,i'll go back up then and go round them
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,okay and go
g,acknowledge,round the pebbled shore
f,acknowledge,and go round what
g,acknowledge,the pebbled shore as well
f,acknowledge,i've go-- i've gone round that uh-huh
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
f,acknowledge,yeah yeah
f,acknowledge,washed stones
g,acknowledge,but you go round your washed stones
f,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,"e" they should be to the right
f,acknowledge,okay
g,acknowledge,so you should have like you take a wide line
g,acknowledge,do you know what i mean
f,acknowledge,yeah i-- yeah i've got it uh-huh
f,acknowledge,yeah
g,acknowledge,have you got a wide line
f,acknowledge,yeah uh-huh
g,acknowledge,yeah are you at finish
f,acknowledge,well i've i've done a wee chink because i went the wrong way i'm just just about yeah i don't know where the finish is but i think it's about here
g,acknowledge,uh-huh
g,acknowledge,right
g,acknowledge,you're a-- maybe about two centimetres above the page
g,acknowledge,oh that's great
f,acknowledge,yeah uh-huh that's that's okay yeah
g,acknowledge,and you've done a wide line
f,acknowledge,yeah got it
f,acknowledge,mmhmm
g,acknowledge,right okay
g,acknowledge,that's it
